"""Controlled simulation clock for April 25 – June 30, 2027 season simulation.

Airtable ``CREATED_TIME()`` / ``Submitted At`` cannot be future-dated via API.
Business dates use writable ``Activity Date`` (and equivalent activity fields).

Production baseline (Submissions):
  Activity Date Is Future? compares Activity Date to NOW() for normal rows.
  Count This Submission? is 0 when Activity Date Is Future? = 1.

Temporary Season Sim gate (authorized runs only) may compare Activity Date to
``Season Sim Clock Now`` when ``Season Sim Test Record?`` is checked and
``Video Upload Note`` contains ``SEASON-SIM|``. Preflight must inspect the live
formula — do not assume NOW()-only forever.

This module does **not** alter production formulas.
