Status: GitHub Source of Truth
Last Synced From Airtable: 2026-08-14
Last GitHub Update: 2026-09-12 (v10.9 Perfect Week Week-End homework boundary)

Purpose:
Create, replay, repair, deactivate, or reactivate the exact canonical
HOMEWORK_XP|<Homework Completion ID> XP Event for one Homework Completion.

Trigger:
Homework Completions when Homework XP Reconciliation Needed? = 1;
pass the dynamic recordId.

Important Tables:
Homework Completions, XP Events, Weekly Athlete Summary,
Program Homework Assignments, Enrollments

Important Fields:
Homework XP Current Signature, Last Homework XP Reconciled Signature,
Homework XP Reconciliation Needed?, Satisfactory?, Review Complete,
Coach Feedback, Total Homework XP Awarded, Source Key, Active?

Notes:
GitHub is the source-of-truth copy. Airtable is the deployed/running copy.
v10.1 installed in Production per Mike evidence; v10.2 is structure-only.

/************************************************************
 * 065 - HOMEWORK REVIEW AND XP
 * Create or Reconcile Homework XP Event
 *
 * Version: v10.9
 * Date Written: 2026-06-06
 * Last Updated: 2026-09-12
 *
 * VERSION HISTORY
 * - v10.9 (2026-09-12): Timing notes / Perfect Week eligibility use assigned Week End
 *   Saturday only (never PHA catch-up Due Date). Homework XP still unblocked by late timing.
 * - v10.8 (2026-09-08): Structured Curriculum HC-only homework may award canonical Homework XP
 *   with zero Submission links when PHA/Enrollment/Week/WAS ownership is valid. Submission-backed
 *   homework remains exact-one-Submission. XP Event Submission topology is immutable across replay.
 * - v10.7 (2026-09-04): SC-160 — early/on-time/late timing tracked; early and late
 *   remain full XP once satisfactory. Perfect Week early/on-time gate stays in 057.
 * - v10.6 (2026-09-03): Late homework remains full XP / credit eligible once satisfactory.
 *   Timing status is tracked as late for reporting; late does not block HOMEWORK_XP.
 *   Perfect Week on-time gate is enforced in 057 (not by withholding homework XP here).
 * - v10.5 (2026-08-31): Ownership assert no longer requires XP Points to already equal
 *   Total Homework XP Awarded. Point changes (e.g. Extra Credit then Base XP) reconcile
 *   by updating the existing HOMEWORK_XP event instead of failing closed on mismatch.
 * - v10.4 (2026-08-28): FUT-001 — PHA eligibility no longer requires HC Item Slot to
 *   match PHA Homework Slot; previously blocked positive XP after PHA Due Date
 *   (superseded by v10.6 late-credit policy).
 * - v10.3 (2026-08-24): Require triggering Homework Completion recordId from
 *   input.config() only — no hardcoded record literals in executable logic;
 *   explicit missing/invalid input errors for safe manual runs.
 * - v10.2 (2026-08-20): V2 Automation Standard structure — GitHub header,
 *   production docblock, SCRIPT metadata, readable CONFIG, numbered sections,
 *   hoisted debugStep, outer run wrapper. Business logic unchanged from v10.1.
 * - v10.1 (2026-08-12): Formula-backed reconcile lifecycle; PHA-first identity;
 *   canonical WAS required for positive award/reactivation; ineligible path
 *   deactivates owned event without WAS. Installed PROD per Mike evidence.
 *
 * PURPOSE
 * - One Homework Completion = one HOMEWORK_XP|<Homework Completion ID> XP Event.
 * - Creates, replays, repairs, deactivates, or reactivates that exact canonical row.
 * - Validates PHA-first identity when Program Homework Assignment exists.
 * - Requires exactly one canonical Weekly Athlete Summary before any positive award or reactivation.
 * - Ineligible corrections deactivate an owned event without requiring a Weekly Athlete Summary.
 *
 * IMPORTANT DESIGN RULES
 * - Source Key is exactly HOMEWORK_XP|{Homework Completion Record ID}.
 * - XP Events are append-only; no XP Event is deleted.
 * - Exact Enrollment, Week, Homework Completion, and Submission topology ownership required.
 *   Submission-backed HCs require exactly one Submission; Structured Curriculum HC-only HCs require zero.
 * - XP Points may differ from Total Homework XP Awarded before step 7 write — that is a
 *   normal reconcile case (do not treat points mismatch as stolen ownership).
 * - Positive award/reactivation requires review eligibility + PHA eligibility (when PHA present)
 *   + Total Homework XP Awarded > 0 + exactly one canonical WAS.
 * - New XP permits exactly one Submission link (traditional path) or zero Submission links (canonical PHA-backed Structured Curriculum path).
 * - Final recheck before create/update is mandatory (Airtable has no atomic uniqueness).
 * - Last Homework XP Reconciled Signature is written only after formula settles and
 *   Homework XP Reconciliation Needed? rereads as 0.
 * - Never write formula / rollup / lookup / count fields.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT
 * - Homework XP prepare / Total Homework XP Awarded writer (064).
 * - Submission Base XP (010).
 * - Achievement / streak / video XP writers (059 / 054 / 114).
 * - Homework Completion create/link (020 / 067).
 *
 * FOLDER
 * - 02 - Homework Review and XP
 *
 * AUTOMATION NAME
 * - 065 - Homework Review and XP - Create or Reconcile Homework XP Event
 *
 * TRIGGER TABLE
 * - Homework Completions
 *
 * RECOMMENDED TRIGGER CONDITIONS
 * - Homework XP Reconciliation Needed? = 1
 * - Input variable recordId = triggering Homework Completion record ID
 *
 * DO NOT USE THIS TRIGGER CONDITION
 * - Satisfactory? alone (cannot observe later withdrawal / signature changes)
 *
 * REQUIRED INPUT VARIABLES
 * - recordId = triggering Homework Completion record ID (map to the trigger
 *   record field in Airtable — never paste a literal test record ID)
 *
 * OUTPUTS (automation script action outputs)
 * - statusOut = success | skipped | error
 * - actionOut = created_or_reactivated | reused_after_recheck |
 *   reconciled_ineligible | error
 * - errorOut = message or empty
 * - debugStep = last step reached
 * - xpEventIdOut / sourceKeyOut / weeklySummaryIdOut
 * - xpEventDeactivatedOut / homeworkWritebackWarningOut
 *
 * PRIMARY TABLES USED
 * - Homework Completions, XP Events, Weekly Athlete Summary,
 *   Program Homework Assignments, Enrollments
 *
 * OUTPUT / WRITEBACK FIELDS
 * - XP Events → ownership links, Source Key, points, Active?, bucket/source, reasons
 * - Homework Completions → XP Events, Award Status, Automation Error (best-effort),
 *   Last Homework XP Reconciled Signature (after settle)
 *
 * SOURCE KEY
 * - HOMEWORK_XP|{Homework Completion Record ID}
