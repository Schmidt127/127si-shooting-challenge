## Airtable native automations (by pipeline)

### Enrollment (001–003)

| # | Table | Trigger (documented) | Script | Downstream |
|---|-------|----------------------|--------|------------|
| 001 | Enrollments | *confirm in Airtable* | `001-...-find-or-create-athlete-and-link-enrollment.js` | Athletes link, enrollment setup |

### Submission intake → XP (005–010, 021–023)

PKG-006R reconciliation fields are installed per Mike's 2026-08-13
attestation. Verify, rather than create or recreate, the exact field contract
in [daily-submission-xp-reconciliation-fields.md](./daily-submission-xp-reconciliation-fields.md).
The trigger wording below is the committed target contract; current Production
version/state/mapping must still be confirmed in the Airtable UI.

| # | Table | Trigger | Script | Downstream |
|---|-------|---------|--------|------------|
| 023 | Submissions | *confirm* | `023-...-assign-enrollment-to-submission.js` | Enrollment link |

| **042** | Enrollments | When record enters view `042 - Needs Level Assignment` (`viwm9OgwkPKI2bii3`); filters `Level Recalc Needed?` checked + `Active?` checked; dynamic `recordId` from triggering Enrollment | `042-...-assign-current-and-next-level-with-gate-blocking.js` (**v4.1.2** — installed and verified) | Current/Next Level, Gate Rule, Status, reconciled signature |
| 043 | Levels | **Retired — do not enable or recreate** | `043-...-set-level-gate-rule-from-next-level.js` (historical source only) | No downstream writer; `042` owns `Level Gate Rule` |

### Email packages (072, 074, 076, 078A, 079, 118–119)

| # | Table | Trigger | Script | Downstream |

### Zoom (101)

| # | Table | Trigger | Script | Downstream |
|---|-------|---------|--------|------------|
| **101** | Zoom Meetings | **When record matches conditions:** sole condition `Zoom XP Reconciliation Needed? = 1`; dynamic triggering Zoom Meeting `recordId` | `101-zoom-attendance-xp-award-meeting-xp.js` (**v6.8** Live — SC-147 recording half-XP in same reconciliation pass; no slot 121). Do **not** use `Create XP Events` as the primary trigger condition. | **XP Events** (live attendance base + cumulative bonuses + SC-147 recording half-XP). Source Keys: live `ZOOM_ATTEND_BASE\|{Zoom Meeting Key}\|{Enrollment RID}`; recording `ZOOM_RECORDING_CREDIT\|{Enrollment RID}\|{Zoom Meeting RID}` |

### PKG-034 Production evidence (Mike-supplied, 2026-08-13)

Automation 101 is **ON** in Production base `appn84sqPw03zEbTT`. The live
trigger has no `Create XP Events`, `Attendees`, or `Completed` condition. The
nine installed reconciliation fields are documented in
[`docs/pkg-034-zoom-reconciliation-fields.md`](../../../docs/pkg-034-zoom-reconciliation-fields.md)
with their Production field IDs. This evidence proves installation and safe
empty-roster acknowledgement only; live-attendee XP and downstream lifecycle
proof remain pending.

### Asset reuse review (116)

| # | Table | Trigger | Script | Downstream |
|---|-------|---------|--------|------------|
| **116** | Submission Assets | **When record updated** · watched field **`Asset Reuse Decision`** · input `recordId` | `116-submission-assets-apply-asset-reuse-decision-consequences.js` | Do Not Award / Award Status suppress; **XP Events** deactivate or restore; Enrollment level recalc flag |

**Production validated 2026-07-10 (script `992677d`):** asset `recF86pJTIMFoEypJ` → VF `rec20xfx0hKCCwPw2` → XP `recx2MvUh2WP0tbjO` · Source Key `VIDEO_SUBMISSION|rec20xfx0hKCCwPw2` · confirm deactivated XP + `Duplicate Status = Duplicate - Remove`; reversal reactivated same row + `Duplicate Status = Unique` · S5A–S5L **12/12 PASS**. Replaced retired **008** (slot-neutral).

## Make.com webhooks (outbound from Airtable)

**Upload plane only** (not parent email). Parent feedback / weekly / welcome / daily notification email is **Communications Hub → Resend** via queue producers (**071** / **073** / **074** / **076** / **117**) and dispatcher **079**.

| Script | Scenario / blueprint | Payload highlights |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 070a | Upload Asset Engine — homework (**PROD Live v4.7** — SC-156) | Submission Asset routing payload |
| 070b | Upload Asset Engine — video | Submission Asset routing payload → Lambda writeback → **070c** verify |
| 071 / 073 / 074 / 076 / 117 | — | **Not Make parent-email senders** — Hub queue create (historical Make email rows obsolete) |
| 077 | Historical only — deleted from Airtable; do not recreate | Former Make daily email |

Blueprint: [../../../make/blueprints/upload-asset-engine-v1.json](../../../make/blueprints/upload-asset-engine-v1.json)

Docs: [../../../make/documentation/upload-asset-engine.md](../../../make/documentation/upload-asset-engine.md)

## Extension scripts (manual / button)

| Script | Mode | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `audit-*` (audits/) | Dry-run default | Pipeline integrity — Stages A–J |
| `backfill-*`, `repair-*`, `dedupe-*` (safe-backfills/) | `DRY_RUN` default | Historical repair |
| `export-schema.js` (schema/) | Read-only | In-base schema export |

## Idempotency keys

| Output | Guard |
|--------|-------|
| XP Events | Source Key / Dedupe Key per script (010, 054, 059, 065, 101, 114) |
| Weekly summary email | Hub queue key + Hub/Delivery writeback (not Make Gmail) |
| Parent feedback emails | Handoff Key on Email Handoff Queue (`071` / `073`); Hub → Resend. **VF Sent?/Delivery fields:** Hub source writeback. **HC Sent?:** still Hub PATCH TBD |
| Make upload | `Send to Make Trigger` + Lambda claim; **070c** clears trigger after verified video writeback |

See [field-map.md](./field-map.md) for canonical field names.

## Testing checklist (per automation)

1. Dry-run matching audit extension after deploy
2. Confirm no duplicate XP Events on automation retry
3. Confirm Make scenario receives expected payload ([test payloads](../../../make/test-payloads/))
4. Update [automation-index.md](../../../docs/automation-index.md) and `CHANGELOG.md`
