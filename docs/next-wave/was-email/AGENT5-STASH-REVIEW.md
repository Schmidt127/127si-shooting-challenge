# Agent 5 stash review — `agent5-118-wip-preserve`

> **HISTORICAL / REFERENCE ONLY.** This dated review is not current operating guidance. Use [`../../ACTIVE-DOCS-INDEX.md`](../../ACTIVE-DOCS-INDEX.md) and [`../../integrations/email-send-plane.md`](../../integrations/email-send-plane.md) for current routing.

**Agent:** 12 · **Date:** 2026-07-24  
**Stash:** `stash@{0}` on master tip at review time  
**Disposition:** **DO NOT APPLY AS A WHOLE** — integrate one documentation correction only (already applied as 118/119 v1.3 docblock/history note).

## What the stash contains

| File | Diff size | Nature |
|---|---|---|
| `118-…-weekly-summary-email-build.js` | ~7 lines | VERSION HISTORY note about live PROD Summary Key shape |
| `lib/c011-weekly-email-schedule.test.js` | ~4 lines | Assert script version `v1.1` → `v1.2` |

No functional create/arm/send logic changes in the stash.

## Compare to current master (pre–Agent 12)

| Topic | Stash | Current master | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 118/119 version | Expects tests for **v1.2** | Already **v1.2** (Denver week-key fix + includeSchmidt) | Stash test bump is **stale** — already satisfied |
| Summary Key note | Clarifies live shape is `{Enrollment Key}\|{Week Key}` = `ATH-…\|season\|weekRecId`, matching `expectedSummaryKey` | Docblock incorrectly said PROD Summary Key is **not** enrollmentKey\|weekKey | Stash clarification is **useful** |
| Logic / dryRun / Schmidt | Unchanged | Already present in v1.2 | Nothing to apply |

## Conflicts

- Applying the full stash on current tip is a **noop or noisy conflict** on the version-assert lines (already v1.2).
- Blind `git stash apply` risk: misleading “already applied” noise; no new tests.

## Test effects

- Stash only changes a string assert for version. Current `c011-weekly-email-schedule.test.js` already expects v1.2.
- Agent 12 bumps scripts to **v1.3** for the Summary Key clarification + empty-week policy hook documentation; tests updated accordingly.

## Integration decision

| Portion | Action |
|---|---|
| Summary Key wording | **Integrate** into 118 VERSION HISTORY (and mirror clarity in was-email docs) |
| Version assert → v1.2 | **Discard** (already true) |
| Rest of stash | **Drop** — keep stash for archaeology or `git stash drop` after Mike confirms |

**Stash disposition label:** `INTEGRATE_DOC_NOTE_ONLY`
