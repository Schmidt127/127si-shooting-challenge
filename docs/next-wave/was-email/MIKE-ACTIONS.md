# Mike Actions — WAS / weekly email

> **HISTORICAL / REFERENCE ONLY.** These dated Make/Gmail actions are complete or superseded. Use [`../../ACTIVE-DOCS-INDEX.md`](../../ACTIVE-DOCS-INDEX.md) for current operator references.

**Updated:** 2026-07-24 (schedules ON; Live writeback verified)

## Done

1. ~~Decide empty-week email policy~~ → **`send_short`**
2. ~~Paste/enforce 072 v4.0~~ → verified `built_short_empty_week`
3. ~~Controlled Schmidt send~~ → Gmail Check-In via 119→074→Make
4. ~~Confirm Make scenario~~ → `Weekly Athlete Summary - Bulk Email - May 18`
5. ~~074 PROD sendMode correction~~ → **`Live`**; Make Live writeback PASS
6. ~~Authorize and enable 118/119 schedules~~ → **ON** (Sun 5:00 / 10:00 AM America/Denver)

## Keep true (do not undo)

1. **074** `sendMode=Live` (or blank + WAS Live) — **never** fixed `Test`.
2. **118 / 119 schedules ON** — do not disable based on older OFF guidance.
3. **072 / 074 / Make Bulk Email May 18 ON**.
4. Prefer 072 `allowSchmidtInput=false` for unattended season traffic.

## Monitor

1. First live Sunday: WAS create volume, email volume, Sent? writebacks, duplicate WAS check.
2. Confirm dryRun/includeSchmidt inputs match intended season posture in UI.
3. **SC-041 retry SOP** (repo ready): if a WAS has `Weekly Email Error` and `Send to Make?` still checked, follow [`WEEKLY-EMAIL-RETRY-SOP.md`](./WEEKLY-EMAIL-RETRY-SOP.md) — re-run **074** once after fix; never retry when `Weekly Email Sent?` is checked. Fixture: SCN-029.

## Do not

- Force **074** `sendMode=Test` as permanent PROD input.  
- Treat **119** as the Make webhook sender.  
- Create a new Make email scenario.  
- Use Make `Weekly Athlete Summary Updated` as the email sender.
