# WAS / weekly email — Agent 12 + verified PROD close (2026-07-24)

> **HISTORICAL / REFERENCE ONLY.** This report documents the former Make/Gmail path. Current delivery is Communications Hub → Resend; see [`../../integrations/email-send-plane.md`](../../integrations/email-send-plane.md).

**Status:** Controlled Schmidt E2E **PASS** for empty-week `send_short` + schedules **ON**  
**Canonical:** [`WAS-WEEKLY-EMAIL-ARCHITECTURE.md`](./WAS-WEEKLY-EMAIL-ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Summary

| Item | State |
|------|--------|
| Flow | `118 → 072 → 119 → 074 → Make → Gmail → Make writeback` |
| Empty-week policy | **`send_short` approved + enforced in 072 v4.0** |
| 118 / 119 | **v1.4** installed; schedules **ON** (Sun 5:00 / 10:00 AM America/Denver) |
| 072 | **v4.0** verified `built_short_empty_week` |
| 074 | Webhook handoff **ON** (repo SoT v2.1); **PROD sendMode=Live** (not fixed Test) |
| Make | `Weekly Athlete Summary - Bulk Email - May 18` **ON**; Live writeback **PASS** |
| 119 role | Arms `Send to Make?` only — **not** the webhook sender |

## Evidence

- WAS `recu4X8m6rWlEWoNy` · Week `recWeVrSabnsYaHc2` (End Key `2026-07-18`)
- Subject: `127 Sports Intensity Weekly Check-In | Testing Schmidt | Testing Week`
- Test Gmail to `mschmidt@fairfield.k12.mt.us` (earlier Test-branch path)
- **Live writeback (2026-07-24):** after 074 input changed from fixed `Test` → `Live`: `Weekly Email Sent?` checked, `Make Send Status=Sent`, sent timestamp populated, email delivered
- **Schedules authorized ON** (verified_prod 2026-07-24) — older OFF guidance superseded (`STALE-CLAIM-CORRECTION.md`)

## Remaining

1. Monitor first live Sunday (118 → 072 → 119 → 074 → Make writeback volume).  
2. Keep 074 PROD sendMode **Live** (or blank + WAS Live) — never fixed Test.  
3. Optional: Make Test-branch Sent? writeback parity (not required for Live season).  
4. Do **not** disable 118/119 based on stale OFF docs.
