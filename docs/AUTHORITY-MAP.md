# Shooting Challenge Authority Map

**Status:** Active
**Backlog:** `SCV2-SEASON-LAUNCH-CONSOLIDATION-001`
**Last updated:** 2026-09-15 (FUT-058 **COMPLETE — CLOSED**; frozen production baselines)

This map defines ownership. It does not assert that a repository document proves
current live configuration.

## Frozen pre-migration production baseline (2026-09-15)

| System | Repository | SHA |
|--------|------------|-----|
| Shooting Challenge | `Schmidt127/127-si-shooting-challenge` | `c0a7eba0d62e9582a259eb6ec180745e7d58251c` |
| Communications Hub | `Schmidt127/127-communication-hub` | `4485af3b6d89c80f2166eab09df38cc1c788b87f` |

Authority detail: [`production-architecture/FROZEN_BASELINE_AND_FUTURE_WORK.md`](./production-architecture/FROZEN_BASELINE_AND_FUTURE_WORK.md). Do not reopen **FUT-058** for optional cleanup. Future platform migration is separate and **not started**.

## Automation version authority (2026-09-14)

> **Script / version authority:** The live, **published Airtable Automation editor / workflow deployment** (published script body + `SCRIPT` header, with UI configuration Mike attests) is authoritative for the automation code running.
>
> The Production `Automations` **tracking table is not authoritative for script versions**.

## Production `Automations` table — scoped identity only (2026-08-20; demoted for versions 2026-09-14)

> When using the tracking table at all, use **only**:
>
> 1. `Name`  
> 2. `Status`  
> 3. `Automation Code` (label — may lag the editor)  
>
> Do **not** use other columns on that table as audit authority. Do **not** treat `Automation Code` as proof of the pasted script body.

**Pre-refresh history:** The old unmaintained table was non-authority. Conclusions that depended on the **pre-refresh** table alone remain retracted for that era. See [`CURRENT-TRUTH.md`](./CURRENT-TRUTH.md) and [`audits/2026-08-20-automation-49-code-audit.md`](./audits/2026-08-20-automation-49-code-audit.md).

## Current authority

| Concern | Authority | Owner / update trigger |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary current-state document** | [`CURRENT-TRUTH.md`](./CURRENT-TRUTH.md) | Cursor; update on git tip changes, Mike overlays, or integrity audits |
| **Frozen production baselines (pre-migration)** | [`production-architecture/FROZEN_BASELINE_AND_FUTURE_WORK.md`](./production-architecture/FROZEN_BASELINE_AND_FUTURE_WORK.md) | FUT-058 close 2026-09-15; change only if Mike authorizes a new freeze |
| **Cold-start architecture pack** | [`production-architecture/README.md`](./production-architecture/README.md) | Cursor; prefer over older overview drafts |
| **Active roadmap** | [`MASTER_REMAINING_WORK_LIST.md`](../MASTER_REMAINING_WORK_LIST.md) | Cursor; roadmap reconcile 2026-09-14 |
| Source code and automation source | GitHub `master` and the committed repository paths | Cursor; update on approved code changes |
| Human-readable release status | [`SHOOTING_CHALLENGE_COMPLETION_MASTER.md`](./SHOOTING_CHALLENGE_COMPLETION_MASTER.md) | Cursor; update when release evidence or blockers change |
| Repository integrity / security registers | [`REPOSITORY-INTEGRITY-AUDIT.md`](./REPOSITORY-INTEGRITY-AUDIT.md) · [`SECURITY-AND-SENSITIVE-FILES.md`](./SECURITY-AND-SENSITIVE-FILES.md) · [`ARCHIVED-AND-SUPERSEDED-FILES.md`](./ARCHIVED-AND-SUPERSEDED-FILES.md) | Cursor; refresh after integrity passes |
| Machine-readable run control | [`agent-runs/CONTROL.json`](./agent-runs/CONTROL.json) | Lead / Integrator; update when a controlled agent package starts, completes, or changes state |
| Live Airtable **automation script version and code** | **Published Airtable Automation editor / workflow deployment** | Mike; dated UI attestation |
| Live Airtable **automation Name / Status / Code labels** | Production `Automations` table (**those three columns only** — not version truth) | Mike refresh 2026-08-20; Cursor may use for inventory labels only |
| Live Airtable **automation triggers / UI wiring** | **Airtable Automations UI** (not other Automations-table columns) | Mike; dated UI attestation |
| Live Airtable **records** (athletes, submissions, XP, etc.) | Airtable UI / named base, not repository text | Mike; verify with a dated read-only export or controlled UI evidence |
| Live Fillout enrollment availability | Fillout UI | Mike; verify before launch activation |
| Live Make, Gmail, Lambda, and email state | Respective service UI / logs | Mike; verify with service evidence; no repository claim substitutes for it |
| Shooting Challenge email delivery | [`integrations/email-send-plane.md`](./integrations/email-send-plane.md) | Mike 2026-08-19: Resend via Communications Hub; Make.com is not the email sender |
| Tremendous award send (C-028) | [`integrations/tremendous-award-fulfillment.md`](./integrations/tremendous-award-fulfillment.md) | Mike-dated evidence; v2 blueprint is an implementation snapshot, not production-live |
| Live Vercel deployment and settings | Vercel project `127-si-shooting-challenge` | Vercel / Mike; verify with read-only CLI or dashboard inspection |
| Release evidence | Dated evidence packages under `docs/prod-completion/`, `docs/testing/evidence/`, and focused deploy checklists | Cursor records evidence boundaries; Mike supplies live-system evidence |
| 2027 season calendar | Airtable **Weeks** table, manually maintained | Mike; verify the target-year export before import or activation |
| Historical records | Dated files under `docs/archive/` and historical evidence folders | Preserve; never treat as current status |
| **Other Automations-table columns** (trigger type, conditions, etc.) | **Not authority** | May still be stale; ignore for V2 audits |

## 2027 season policy

- Challenge window: **May 1–June 30, 2027**.
- Early Bird normal calendar: **April 25–May 1, 2027**.
- Week 1 starts **May 2, 2027**.
- Airtable Weeks is the season-calendar authority.
- There is no fixed number of weeks.
- Every new season starts at Level 1 with 0 season XP.
- Fillout manually controls enrollment availability.
- The current today-based Early Bird record is a temporary testing fixture and
  must be shortened or replaced before the 2027 launch.

## Evidence boundaries

Repository code and offline tests can prove contracts, deterministic behavior,
and expected outputs. They cannot prove current Airtable installation, Fillout
availability, Make/Gmail sends, or Vercel settings. Controlled automation-action
testing is not natural-trigger proof, offline tests are not controlled PROD
proof, and successful 115 creation does not prove 005/009/020/064/XP/summary or
email behavior.

The Production base’s **`Automations` data table** may be used for **`Name` / `Status` / `Automation Code` labels only**. **Script version authority is the Automation editor.** Other columns on that table may still be stale. Pre-refresh historical exports (for example
`foundation-reset/PROD-AUTOMATION-VERSION-INVENTORY-2026-07-23.md`) remain
**historical / non-authority** for Version 2 decisions.

Automation 115 intentionally creates one new production-shaped Submission per
explicit checked Run Test request. That behavior is not idempotency. Downstream
Homework Completion reuse is a separate contract.

## Document routing

- Current state (git, bases, overlays, ledger): `CURRENT-TRUTH.md`.
- Release status: Completion Master.
- Run coordination: `agent-runs/CONTROL.json`.
- Backlog: `v2-change-backlog.md`.
- Live operations snapshot: `PROJECT_STATE.md`; it must link here and to
  `CURRENT-TRUTH.md`, and must not present itself as the release-status master.
- Tremendous awards (C-028): `integrations/tremendous-award-fulfillment.md`.
- Email delivery: `integrations/email-send-plane.md` (Resend; Make is not the email sender).
- Architecture, operator runbooks, test specifications, and release evidence
  retain their narrow purpose and link current status here.
- Historical status packets are preserved under `docs/archive/` or carry the
  required historical-reference notice.

## Stale-reference audit

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
node tools/testing/audit-source-of-truth.mjs
```

The audit scans active source-of-truth and operational paths. Historical
material under `docs/archive/`, dated evidence directories, and files explicitly
listed in its exception manifest are allowed to retain superseded versions,
branches, PRs, and claims when their historical context is clear.
