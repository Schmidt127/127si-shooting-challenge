# 127 Sports Intensity ? Master Future Work List



**Project:** 127 Sports Intensity Shooting Challenge and public website  

**Repository:** `Schmidt127/127-si-shooting-challenge`  

**Created:** 2026-08-24  
**Reconciled:** 2026-09-14 — master roadmap reconcile ([`MASTER_REMAINING_WORK_LIST.md`](../MASTER_REMAINING_WORK_LIST.md) · [`roadmap/README.md`](./roadmap/README.md)). Prior 2026-09-12: [`audits/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH-RECONCILIATION-20260912.md`](./audits/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH-RECONCILIATION-20260912.md)

**Purpose:** Detailed future-work narrative and history. **Active non-duplicative roadmap:** [`MASTER_REMAINING_WORK_LIST.md`](../MASTER_REMAINING_WORK_LIST.md). Each item is written so it can later become a focused Cursor or Airtable/OMNI prompt.

## Required before close (authoritative)

| ID | Status | Notes |
|----|--------|-------|
| **SC-SEASON-SIM-PERFECT-202231Z** | **COMPLETE / historical** | Perfect Mike Schmidt path **PASSED** pre-restore **4980 / 170** — run `SEASON-SIM-PERFECT-20260914T202231Z-mike-schmidt`. Post-restore 4525 expected. Formulas restored; cleanup closed. Future Perfect runs use [`SC-SEASON-SIM-PERFECT-OPERATOR-GUIDE.md`](./deploy-checklists/SC-SEASON-SIM-PERFECT-OPERATOR-GUIDE.md). |
| **SC-SEASON-SIM-001** | **READY — NOT EXECUTED** | **Three-athlete** season simulation only. Requires exact owner authorization (`RUN 3-ATHLETE SEASON SIMULATION`). |
| **SC-SEASON-SIM-002** | **COMPLETE (infrastructure / package closed)** | Do not re-run T122531Z. |
| **MRW-L02 / FUT-053** | Launch-critical plan | Stripe coupon / 100% payment writeback — plan only until Mike activates. |
| **MRW-L03 / FUT-054** | Launch-critical plan | Player Manual + Game Manual Addendum — outline only until Mike publishes. |

**Superseded claims (do not revive):** “season simulation unexecuted” as applied to the Perfect Mike path; “18 PHA” as current calendar truth (now **20**, Week 9 ×2); Automations tracking table as script-version authority.

Curriculum Hub Homework lifecycle, private SEO, 52 structured-enabled lessons, SC Assignment Key Sync, and lesson hero are **COMPLETE** — remove from active future work; reopen Hub only for Production defects. New planning IDs **FUT-049 … FUT-057** live under [`roadmap/planning/`](./roadmap/planning/).

## Optional / deferred (not close blockers)

- SMS / Twilio
- Additional Curriculum lessons beyond the verified 52
- Cosmetic / polish
- Orchestration / agent improvements
- Enhancements (including deferred **FUT-029**, **FUT-048**, optional AUT pastes, Mike-owned Interface fine-tuning)

## Mike-approved decisions ? 2026-08-27



These decisions are authoritative for future implementation prompts and production configuration.



### Streak rewards



After an athlete's shooting streak ends, a new streak begins automatically. Streak achievements and their rewards may be earned again on later qualifying streaks. Deterministic instance keys and deduplication must still prevent duplicate credit for the same streak instance.



### Recorded Zoom meetings



Recorded Zoom meetings do not count toward Perfect Week requirements. They do count toward level-gate advancement and earn **one-half of the normal live-attendance XP**. Live attendance and recorded-meeting credit must remain distinct and must not create duplicate credit for the same meeting.



### 2026?2027 early-bird registration



Use an early-bird registration period for the 2026?2027 challenge. Dates, pricing, eligibility, cutoff behavior, and payment/writeback handling must be defined and tested before activation. This decision does not activate registration or change the current paid-only FUT-003 Make scenario by itself.



### Program naming and public taxonomy (2026-08-31)



**Preferred program name:** Jr. Referee Clinic. **Acceptable short form** where space is limited: Jr. Ref Clinic. **Never use:** Jr. Ref.



**Public taxonomy:** Use **Youth Programs** (not ?Youth opportunities?) for Shooting Challenge, Dribbling Challenge, and Jr. Referee Clinic. Use **Coach Tools** for Brackets, Team Shot Tracker, and **State Rankings** (not ?State Standings?).



### Coach Tools product naming ? State Rankings (2026-09-01)



**Preferred public name:** **State Rankings** (matches `/rankings` app and `apps.ts`). **Do not use:** State Standings.



### SC-034 / Perfect Week config closeout (2026-08-27)



Repository and Production closeout for the bounded SC-034 / V2-002 pass:



| Item | Status | Evidence |

|---|---|---|

| **V2-002 / SC-034** repository implementation | **COMPLETE** | `audits/2026-08-27-SC-034-config-hardcode-audit.md`; `lib/config-selection/`; 57-script scan; contract tests |

| **Automation 057 v2.2** | **COMPLETE (live script)** | Config schema renamed; live script uses `Perfect Week Video Minimum`; Automations Code tracker may lag ? do not repaste |

| **Config-driven Perfect Week video minimum** | **COMPLETE** | Config field **`Perfect Week Video Minimum`** = 3; `lib/config-selection/perfect-week-video-minimum.js` |

| **WAS Config lookup + formula** | **COMPLETE** | Lookup **`Config: Perfect Week Video Minimum`**; formula **`Perfect Week Video Requirement Met?`** live PROD |

| **Automation 059 trigger correction** | **COMPLETE** | Mike removed `Shot Milestone is not empty` filter; Pending-only created trigger ? [`059-perfect-week-trigger-coverage.md`](./deploy-checklists/059-perfect-week-trigger-coverage.md) |

| **058/059 script changes** | **Not required** | `docs/testing/perfect-week/PERFECT-WEEK-DEPENDENCY-AUDIT.md` ? eligibility from 057 + WAS formulas |

| **Disposable Perfect Week end-to-end test** | **COMPLETE** | **SC-PW-E2E** ? WAS `recl3DmBh22ADPWWe` unlock Awarded + 100 XP. Evidence `docs/testing/evidence/sc-pw-e2e/award-was-recl3DmBh22ADPWWe-2026-08-29-mcp.json`. Do not re-`--apply`. |

| **General schema field typo renames** | **DEFERRED** | `Perfect Week Video Minimum` typo fixed; gate summary / Softr flag / HC RID typos ? SAFE-MIGRATION-PLAN P3; **SC-144** |



## How to use this document



- This is the single planning list for future work.

- Each item is intentionally separate so it can be implemented, tested, and closed independently.

- Do not begin implementation from a vague note. Convert the item into a Phase 2 implementation brief first.

- Production Airtable changes, live sends, payment activation, and destructive cleanup remain Mike-approved actions.

- Technical evidence, deployment checklists, test reports, current-truth records, and historical closeout evidence are not replaced by this list.



## Status and priority vocabulary



**Operator snapshot (Section G):** **COMPLETE** Ã‚Â· **IN PROGRESS** Ã‚Â· **BLOCKED** Ã‚Â· **READY** Ã‚Â· **DEFERRED**



| Snapshot status | Meaning |

|---|---|

| **COMPLETE** | Implemented and verified (repo and/or Production as cited in evidence). |

| **IN PROGRESS** | Active work, partial proof, or Production paste/attestation still open. |

| **BLOCKED** | Waiting on an explicit owner decision or external dependency. |

| **READY** | Requirements clear; not started or queued for next prompt. |

| **DEFERRED** | Intentionally postponed or rejected direction. |



**Legacy narrative sections (A?F)** may still use older labels (`Planned`, `Live Tested in PROD`, `Built in Repository`, etc.). Treat **Section G** as the current operator queue.



| Legacy status | Meaning |

|---|---|

| Brainstormed | Idea captured; requirements still need refinement. |

| Planned | Product direction is clear enough to write an implementation prompt. |

| Ready for prompt | Requirements and acceptance criteria are sufficiently defined. |

| In progress | Work has started. |

| Deferred | Intentionally postponed. |

| Complete | Future request is fully implemented and verified. |

| Not approved | Explicitly rejected or replaced. |



Priority: **P0** launch/security blocker Ã‚Â· **P1** important parent/athlete experience or reliability Ã‚Â· **P2** valuable improvement Ã‚Â· **P3** low priority/future experiment.

## A. Airtable and application behavior



### FUT-001 ? Match homework by assignment identity, not HW1/HW2 slot



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** Assignment-identity Complete (GitHub + Production). **Late-credit policy (2026-09-03):** GitHub **020 v3.9 / 065 v10.6 / 057 v2.4** via PR **#372** (+ live 057 advanced to **2.4**). Production **Automations Code** 2026-09-04 MCP: **020 v3.9 / 065 v10.6 / 057 2.4** all **Live** (**PASTE-ALIGNED**). **Disposable late-HW / Perfect Week exclusion behavior proof COMPLETE 2026-09-04** ? [`audits/FUT-001-LATE-CREDIT-LIVE-PROOF-20260904.md`](./audits/FUT-001-LATE-CREDIT-LIVE-PROOF-20260904.md) Ã‚Â· [`testing/evidence/fut-001-late-credit/closeout-20260904.json`](./testing/evidence/fut-001-late-credit/closeout-20260904.json).  

**Systems:** Airtable, homework intake, Homework Completions, XP, parent submission flow



Allow a parent or athlete to submit an assignment in either visible homework slot. The system must identify the assignment by its assignment/lesson identity and match it to the correct scheduled assignment. The HW number is not authoritative because slot numbering may change from year to year.



**Approved late-credit policy (2026-09-03):** Homework remains selectable whenever visible or assigned through a PHA. Students may submit before, during, or after the official week. Late satisfactory homework receives **full credit and normal XP**. Grading delay does not penalize. Submission Date is the student?s submission date. Needs Revision receives no homework XP until satisfactory. Revisions update the existing completion (no duplicate HC / XP Event). Late homework counts toward total homework history, XP, level gates, and the private dashboard, but **does not** count toward Perfect Week for the original week.



The system must preserve checks for assignment identity, enrollment, challenge/season, and duplicate credit. Multiple uploads or repeat submissions are allowed, but only one Homework Completion and one XP award may be credited for the same athlete, assignment identity, and enrollment context.



**Acceptance criteria:** correct assignment matching across either slot; late full-credit XP once satisfactory; Perfect Week on-time gate; repeat uploads reviewable; XP deduplicated; no dependence on HW1/HW2 names.



**Implementation (2026-08-25):** GitHub **020 v3.8** + **065 v10.4**; contracts in `lib/homework-contracts/assignment-identity.js`. Promotion doc: [FUT-001-homework-assignment-identity-deadline.md](./deploy-checklists/FUT-001-homework-assignment-identity-deadline.md).



**PR #264 (2026-08-28):** Branch `fix/fut-001-homework-assignment-identity` ? commit `91c65b36` + CI fix `3d497f4a` (065 offline Weeks mock). **Merged.** Production Automations Code **020 v3.8 / 065 v10.4 Live** (MCP 2026-08-29/30) at that time.



**PR #372 (2026-09-03):** Late-credit policy ? merge `da009262`. Operator checklist: [`deploy-checklists/homework-late-credit-policy-020-057-065.md`](./deploy-checklists/homework-late-credit-policy-020-057-065.md). Automations Code column **PASTE-ALIGNED** 2026-09-03 (Agent 4 MCP). **Do not paste from agents.**



**Live disposable proof (2026-09-04 Agent 4):** Late HC Submission Date after PHA Due Date ? full `HOMEWORK_XP` (35) on official Early Bird week; Perfect Week homework satisfactory count stayed **0**; no duplicate XP on re-grade. Report: [`audits/FUT-001-LATE-CREDIT-LIVE-PROOF-20260904.md`](./audits/FUT-001-LATE-CREDIT-LIVE-PROOF-20260904.md).



### FUT-002 ? Audit and remove unused Airtable fields



**Priority:** P2  

**Status:** **Batch 1 COMPLETE (2026-08-31)** + **SA XP text stubs deleted (2026-08-31)** + **Batch 2 COMPLETE (2026-09-05)** â€” five Batch 2 text-stub field IDs absent (four UI-deleted this session; row #3 prior). Live Meta: **1375 fields / 35 tables**. Schema `airtable/schema/snapshots/prod-20260905-fut002-batch2/`. Evidence [`testing/evidence/fut-002/batch2-live-verify-20260905.json`](./testing/evidence/fut-002/batch2-live-verify-20260905.json). Later: Config Drive roots + `unknown` interface review.  

**Systems:** Airtable schema, automations, email payloads, website/data contracts



Inventory every Airtable table and identify fields that are unused, obsolete, duplicated, or no longer part of the current app. This includes legacy Google Drive URL, Google Drive ID, Google Drive folder ID, and similarly named fields. Check formulas, automations, scripts, emails, views, interfaces, website/data contracts, and documentation before deleting anything.



Because all current records are test data that will be deleted before the next challenge, no historical-value preservation is required. The cleanup must still distinguish truly unused fields from fields needed by current production or future-approved workflows.



After confirming no active dependency remains, delete the obsolete fields and update documentation, schema snapshots, field maps, tests, and any remaining references.



**Acceptance criteria:** complete field/dependency inventory; unused and obsolete fields classified; fields removed only after audit; tests and documentation updated; no active S3/Lambda or future-approved fields removed accidentally.



**Audit deliverables (2026-08-30):** [`docs/audits/FUT-002-unused-field-inventory-2026-08-30.md`](./audits/FUT-002-unused-field-inventory-2026-08-30.md) Ã‚Â· [`docs/audits/fut-002-unused-field-inventory.json`](./audits/fut-002-unused-field-inventory.json) Ã‚Â· tool `tools/airtable/fut_002_field_inventory.py`. Offline snapshot (pre-cleanup): **1347 fields**.



**Live cleanup (2026-08-30 ? batch-1 close 2026-08-31):** [`docs/audits/field-inventory/`](./audits/field-inventory/) Ã‚Â· [`docs/audits/FUT-002-cleanup-session-2026-08-30.md`](./audits/FUT-002-cleanup-session-2026-08-30.md) Ã‚Â· [`docs/audits/FUT-002-cleanup-queue.md`](./audits/FUT-002-cleanup-queue.md) Ã‚Â· packet [`docs/deploy-checklists/FUT-002-batch1-quarantined-field-delete.md`](./deploy-checklists/FUT-002-batch1-quarantined-field-delete.md). Quarantine day: **1355 fields / 33 tables**; Asset Key retargeted; five fields quarantined then **Mike UI-deleted**. Post-delete verify: [`testing/evidence/fut-002/batch1-live-verify.json`](./testing/evidence/fut-002/batch1-live-verify.json) Ã‚Â· schema `airtable/schema/snapshots/prod-20260831-fut002-batch1/` (**1350** fields). Meta API still cannot DELETE fields (404) ? UI required for any future batch.



**Submission Assets XP text stubs (2026-08-31):** Mike UI-deleted unused `XP Events` (`fldwOklyDaW3nN2Kz`) and `XP Events copy` (`fld5Emwipb3UjAMz9`) ? single-line text only; not XP link fields. Packet: [`deploy-checklists/FUT-002-sa-xp-text-stubs-delete.md`](./deploy-checklists/FUT-002-sa-xp-text-stubs-delete.md). Evidence: [`testing/evidence/fut-002/sa-xp-text-stubs-deleted-2026-08-31.json`](./testing/evidence/fut-002/sa-xp-text-stubs-deleted-2026-08-31.json).



**Batch 2 COMPLETE (2026-09-05):** Mike UI-deleted four quarantined stubs; row #3 already gone. Post-delete verify PASS. Packet [`docs/deploy-checklists/FUT-002-batch2-quarantined-field-delete.md`](./deploy-checklists/FUT-002-batch2-quarantined-field-delete.md) Â· closeout [`docs/audits/FUT-002-BATCH2-POST-DELETE-CLOSEOUT-20260905.md`](./audits/FUT-002-BATCH2-POST-DELETE-CLOSEOUT-20260905.md) Â· evidence [`testing/evidence/fut-002/batch2-live-verify-20260905.json`](./testing/evidence/fut-002/batch2-live-verify-20260905.json) Â· schema `airtable/schema/snapshots/prod-20260905-fut002-batch2/`.



### FUT-003 ? Stripe payment writeback to Airtable



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** **Paid route validated ? ready for Mike Make activation** (2026-08-26 Maia; A5 re-audit 2026-09-04). Make scenario remains **inactive** by design until Mike turns it ON. Free/$0 path **deferred Nov/Dec 2026**. Not a website/XP launch blocker; **required when paid registration opens**.  

**Systems:** Fillout webhook, Make.com, Stripe API, Airtable `Payment Transactions` + `Enrollments`  

**Make scenario:** `FUT-003 - Fillout Stripe Payment to Airtable Payment Transactions` ? **inactive** at validation time; ready for Mike activation when approved  

**Audit (2026-09-04):** [`docs/audits/FUT-003-STRIPE-STATUS-20260904.md`](./audits/FUT-003-STRIPE-STATUS-20260904.md)



After Stripe accepts a registration payment, write the payment result back to Airtable. At minimum, capture the amount paid and whether a coupon or promotion code was used.



**Verified paid-only workflow (2026-08-26 ? controlled Production Make test, scenario inactive):**



| Step | Result |

|------|--------|

| Fillout webhook receives submission | Pass |

| Payload normalized (Module 4) | Pass |

| One **10-second delay** before Enrollment lookup | Present by design |

| Enrollment found via `{Fillout Submission Id} = "{{4.filloutSubmissionId}}"` (Module 16) | Pass |

| Stripe **PaymentIntent** retrieved (Module 6) | Pass |

| Payment amount calculated correctly (cents ? dollars) | Pass ? **$2.00** test |

| Payment Transactions duplicate search runs once (Module 7) | Pass |

| One **Payment Transactions** record created (Module 8) | Pass |

| Enrollment linked once (Module 12) | Pass |

| Duplicate protection | Pass ? no duplicate transaction on replay |

| **Payment Status** = `Paid` | Pass |

| **Stripe Payment ID** stored | Pass |

| **Actual Amount Paid** stored | Pass ? `$2.00` |

| **Fillout Submission ID** stored | Pass |

| **Payment Date** stored | Pass |

| **Make Processed At** stored | Pass |



**Final tested transaction (Maia report):** Actual Amount Paid `$2.00` Ã‚Â· Payment Status `Paid` Ã‚Â· one Payment Transactions row Ã‚Â· one Enrollment link update Ã‚Â· no duplicate row.



**Scope note:** This validation covers the **paid PaymentIntent path only**. It does **not** change Airtable XP logic, XP calculations, or XP award amounts.



**Deferred until November/December 2026 (do not mark complete):**



| Item | Status |

|------|--------|

| 100% coupon / $0 payment route | **Deferred** |

| `No Payment Required` payment status | **Deferred** |

| Stripe Checkout Session webhook route | **Deferred** |

| Stripe metadata correlation | **Deferred** |

| Custom Checkout Session creation | **Deferred** |

| Coupon / promotion-code capture | **Deferred** (Fillout webhook gap) |

| Enterprise webhook architecture | **Deferred** |

| Advanced Stripe reconciliation | **Deferred** |



Do **not** add a blank **Stripe Payment ID** route to the current paid-only workflow.



**Acceptance criteria (paid path):** paid test payment with amount + duplicate protection + enrollment linkage + field writeback ? **verified**; coupon/promotion evidence ? **deferred**; discounted/zero-dollar test ? **deferred** (free route not built).



**Promotion doc:** [FUT-003-fillout-stripe-payment-writeback.md](./deploy-checklists/FUT-003-fillout-stripe-payment-writeback.md)



### FUT-004 ? Automated award emailer to replace Tremendous



**Priority:** P3  

**Status:** Deferred  

**Systems:** Airtable awards, email/communications system, future reward provider if needed



Do not continue the Tremendous integration for awards. Later, design and implement an automated award emailer as its replacement. Keep the first version simple and defer provider selection and advanced requirements until the app?s remaining automation capacity is known.



The future prompt should define which award types are included, who receives the email, how duplicate sends are prevented, and how delivery status is recorded.



### FUT-005 ? Automated accomplishment emails



**Priority:** P3  

**Status:** Deferred  

**Systems:** Airtable XP/achievement events, communications system



Future automated emails may notify families about meaningful accomplishments:



- Streak occurrence

- Shot milestone reached

- Challenge shot goal met



This is intentionally separate from the award emailer and should not be started until the current automation inventory and remaining capacity are reviewed.



### FUT-006 ? Parent-facing email workflows available for the upcoming challenge



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** Complete  

**Systems:** Daily Submission, Welcome, Weekly Summary, Zoom Attendance, Video/Homework Feedback emails



The current parent-facing email workflows are functional and can be used for the upcoming challenge:



- Daily Submission email

- Welcome email

- Weekly Summary email

- Zoom Attendance email, which is not yet in Production



Optional future work may improve visual presentation or wording, but email functionality is not a blocker for the upcoming challenge.



**Remaining writeback gap:** ~~Weekly Athlete Summary Sent? after Hub ? Resend (still TBD)~~ **CLOSED in repo** (2026-09-01) ? Hub `source-writeback-weekly-summary.js` + contract `WEEKLY_SUMMARY_SOURCE_WRITEBACK_v1.md`; **paste/deploy pending** ([`deploy-checklists/FUT-006-weekly-was-hub-writeback.md`](./deploy-checklists/FUT-006-weekly-was-hub-writeback.md)). Homework Completions Sent?/Sent On ? **FUT-032 COMPLETE** (2026-08-31 Mike verify). Hub PR [#42](https://github.com/Schmidt127/communications/pull/42) **MERGED**.



---



## B. AWS storage and secure media



### FUT-007 ? Simplify future AWS media naming and support future media types



**Priority:** P2  

**Status:** **Phase 3 prep shipped** ? Lambda code behind flag (`USE_FUT007_BASENAME` default off); DEV deploy pending  

**Systems:** Upload Lambda, S3, Airtable storage-key/writeback fields  

**Spec:** [FUT-007-AWS-MEDIA-NAMING-SPEC.md](./next-wave/aws-media/FUT-007-AWS-MEDIA-NAMING-SPEC.md) Ã‚Â· Promotion: [FUT-007-aws-media-naming.md](./deploy-checklists/FUT-007-aws-media-naming.md) Ã‚Â· Prep helpers: [`lib/aws-media-naming/`](../lib/aws-media-naming/) Ã‚Â· Lambda: [`upload_core/fut007_basename.py`](../lambda/upload-asset/upload_core/fut007_basename.py)



Change the naming convention for future uploads only. Existing test uploads will be deleted before the next challenge, so no migration is required. Supported future upload categories should include:



- `HW` for homework

- `VIDEO` for video feedback

- `HEADSHOT` for future athlete headshot uploads; this is not currently in use but should be supported by the naming design



Proposed pattern:



`YYYYMMDD_HW-or-VIDEO-or-HEADSHOT_LastName_FirstName_CustomVideoName`



Examples:



- `20260817_HW_Boltz_Drew_ShotChallenge`

- `20260817_VIDEO_Boltz_Drew_OffTheDribble`

- `20260817_HEADSHOT_Boltz_Drew_Profile`



Do not include the Airtable record ID in the filename. Use the **Custom Video File Name** in the final filename position. The Airtable record ID remains system metadata and is not part of the human-facing filename.



The prompt must define sanitization, collision handling, missing-name behavior, and preservation of the Airtable record ID elsewhere as system metadata.



**Delivered (2026-09-01):** Full spec + promotion checklist + `lib/aws-media-naming/` offline tests (21 vitest cases). **Phase 3 prep (2026-09-01):** `upload_core/fut007_basename.py` + `storage_key.py` integration behind `USE_FUT007_BASENAME` (default off). **No Lambda deploy.**



### FUT-008 ? Custom Video File Name field and parent-facing usage



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** Complete ? field created; future workflow remains in FUT-009  

**Systems:** Airtable Video Feedback, correction interface, S3 upload naming, parent emails, website



The Airtable field **Custom Video File Name** has already been created and is ready for use in the Video Feedback correction interface. Mike should be able to enter names such as `OffTheDribble`, `FreeThrows`, or `ShootingInTheRain`.



Use the Custom Video File Name everywhere a parent-facing or coach-facing descriptive video name is appropriate, including the future S3 filename, Video Feedback display, email copy, and website display. Preserve the original upload metadata separately when needed for audit/debugging.



### FUT-009 ? AWS storage structure and corrected-video naming workflow



**Priority:** P2  

**Status:** **COMPLETE / Live Tested (2026-09-04)** ? Lambda `POST /fut009/rename` live; Automation **120** deployed **Live**; disposable Schmidt rename + idempotent re-run + dual S3 object proof passed. Writeback omits absent Formatted Upload Name; activity date resolves from SA `Date`.  

**Systems:** Video Feedback correction interface, Lambda/S3, Airtable links  

**Audit (2026-09-04):** [`docs/audits/FUT-009-LAMBDA-STATUS-20260904.md`](./audits/FUT-009-LAMBDA-STATUS-20260904.md)



Combine the AWS bucket-structure review and corrected-video naming workflow into one future project. Review the current bucket structure, folder/key organization, naming rules, retention expectations, and separation of homework, video, and future headshot assets.



When Mike corrects a video and supplies a Custom Video File Name, provide a safe workflow to apply that name to the stored object or create a clearly named replacement object. The secure Lambda Reviewer URL must remain valid or be regenerated safely. The workflow must not create duplicate XP, duplicate Video Feedback records, or broken parent links.



Keep the S3 bucket private and preserve the Lambda viewer architecture.



**Delivered (2026-09-01):** Phase 2 brief ? [`docs/next-wave/aws-media/FUT-009-AWS-STORAGE-STRUCTURE-BRIEF.md`](./next-wave/aws-media/FUT-009-AWS-STORAGE-STRUCTURE-BRIEF.md). **Implementation (2026-09-01):** FUT-009 rename worker (`lambda/upload-asset/upload_core/fut009_rename.py`), Option D destination builder, dual-prefix Storage Key validation (FUT-010 alignment), CLI `tools/airtable/fut_009_video_rename.py` (recovery/backfill only), extension `fut-009-video-rename.js`, **Automation 120** automatic trigger (`120-?-apply-fut009-s3-video-rename.js`), Lambda `POST /fut009/rename`, promotion doc [`docs/deploy-checklists/FUT-009-aws-storage-rename.md`](./deploy-checklists/FUT-009-aws-storage-rename.md). Coach confirmation via **Confirm S3 Video Rename** triggers Automation 120. **Activated (2026-09-04):** CodeOnly Lambda deploy + disposable Production rename proof; Automations Status **Live**. Optional residual: secret rotation; PKG-004 audit fields; Formatted Upload Name if product wants basename writeback.



### FUT-010 ? Delete Airtable intake attachments after verified S3 upload



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** **Dry-run complete (2026-08-30)** ? 0 eligible rows in Production preflight/reconcile; supervised apply pending Mike attestation + AWS creds  

**Systems:** Airtable, Submission Assets, Homework Completions, AWS S3, Lambda viewer pipeline



Reduce Airtable storage usage by deleting the original **Submission Assets** intake attachment after the uploaded file has been successfully written to AWS S3 and the durable file path is confirmed.



**Scope note:** Homework coverage means **homework-route Submission Assets** (`Upload Destination = Homework Completions`). Legacy **`Homework Completions.Airtable Attachment`** is **out of scope** ? separate future work (see SC-100 / FUT-002).



**Requirements:**



- Apply to homework-route and video-route **Submission Assets** intake attachments.

- Confirm `Upload Status = Uploaded`.

- Confirm the S3 object exists and is accessible through the expected AWS storage path.

- Confirm the stored S3 key is present.

- Confirm the Lambda viewer URL or other approved parent-facing URL is valid where applicable.

- Delete only the Airtable attachment contents.

- Never delete the Airtable record.

- Never delete the S3 object.

- Never delete an attachment when the upload is pending, failed, incomplete, or uncertain.

- Preserve all Airtable record links, S3 storage keys, upload status, review status, XP links, and audit metadata.

- Make the deletion idempotent and safe to retry.

- Include a reconciliation process for records where the Airtable attachment remains after a successful upload.

- Prevent reprocessing from creating duplicate S3 objects, duplicate Video Feedback records, duplicate Homework Completions, or duplicate XP.

- Add a dry-run mode before any destructive attachment cleanup.

- Require logging of record ID, asset purpose, S3 key, verification result, deletion result, and failure reason.

- Do not delete Airtable attachments until the AWS verification step has passed.



**Related items:** FUT-007 (future AWS media naming), FUT-009 (AWS storage structure and corrected-video workflow), **FUT-040** (automatic migration orchestration + headshots ? extends this item; do not duplicate), SC-094 (video storage on program-owned S3), SC-095 (homework storage on S3 via 070a), SC-096 (canonical HTTPS URLs on assets), SC-099 (writeback verification via 070c), SC-100 (attachment / Drive retirement strategy ? broader planning; remains deferred).



**Acceptance criteria:**



1. A successfully uploaded **homework-route Submission Asset** attachment is verified in S3 and then removed from Airtable.

2. A successfully uploaded **video-route Submission Asset** attachment is verified in S3 and then removed from Airtable.

3. Failed or uncertain uploads retain their Airtable attachment.

4. Re-running the cleanup does not create duplicate files or fail incorrectly.

5. S3/Lambda links continue to work after the Airtable attachment is removed.

6. The Airtable record and all application metadata remain intact.

7. A dry-run report identifies eligible, skipped, and failed records without deleting anything.

8. Automated tests cover successful cleanup, failed upload, missing S3 object, invalid URL, retry, and duplicate-processing cases.



**Implementation (2026-08-28, revised):** Shared helpers `lib/intake-attachment-cleanup/` (fail-closed verification contract); CLI `tools/airtable/fut_010_intake_attachment_cleanup.py` (dry-run default, reconcile filter on apply, per-record AWS error skip, `--confirm-delete` required); extension `airtable/extension-scripts/safe-backfills/fut-010-clear-intake-attachments.js`. **Out of scope:** `Homework Completions.Airtable Attachment`.

## D. Website SEO and national discoverability



### FUT-020 ? National-first SEO foundation with legitimate local context



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** Complete (2026-08-26) ? merged to `master` 2026-08-27 (`94c018e`, `ee5d3fd`)  

**Systems:** Website metadata, content, structured data, sitemap, internal links  

**Evidence:** `web/docs/seo.md`, `web/lib/seo/metadata.ts`, `web/tests/search-indexing.spec.ts`



Optimize the website so families nationwide can discover the program when searching for youth basketball training, basketball shooting challenges, skill development, progress tracking, and related terms. Fairfield, Montana should be represented accurately but should not be the only SEO strategy or the dominant focus.



Do not claim in-person services in locations where the program does not operate. Use Fairfield and nearby communities where accurate, and explain online/remote or nationally accessible aspects where supported.



### FUT-021 ? Homepage SEO and messaging



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** Complete (2026-08-26) ? merged to `master` 2026-08-27 (`94c018e`, `ee5d3fd`)  

**Systems:** Homepage copy, metadata, internal links  

**Evidence:** `web/components/home/home-page-view.tsx`, `web/lib/seo/program-facts.ts`, `web/tests/national-seo.spec.ts`



Rewrite the homepage title, main heading, description, internal links, and image alt text so the page clearly communicates:



- Youth basketball training and shooting challenges

- Boys and girls in grades 1?8

- Educational Athletics

- Skill development, daily submissions, goals, progress tracking, and feedback

- Accurate Fairfield, Montana context without limiting national discovery



### FUT-022 ? Adapt existing pages for SEO before creating duplicates



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** Complete (2026-08-26) ? merged to `master` 2026-08-27 (`94c018e`, `ee5d3fd`)  

**Systems:** Route audit, existing page adaptations  

**Evidence:** `web/docs/seo.md` Ã‚Â§ FUT-022 route audit; only new route: `/faq`



Audit the existing website before adding pages. Adapt an existing page when it already covers the subject. Create a new page only when the content has no appropriate home.



Potential content areas include youth basketball program, shooting challenge, youth basketball training, Team Shot Tracker, About, Activities and Events, Contact, and FAQ. The implementation prompt must identify the existing route map first and prevent duplicate or competing pages.



### FUT-023 ? Page-specific titles, descriptions, links, and image text



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** Complete (2026-08-26) ? merged to `master` 2026-08-27 (`94c018e`, `ee5d3fd`)  

**Systems:** Per-page metadata, hub link labels, feature banner aria labels  

**Evidence:** `web/app/(program)/*/page.tsx`, `web/lib/navigation/program-hub-links.ts`, `web/tests/feature-images.spec.ts`



Give every important public page unique metadata and descriptive internal links. Replace vague links such as `Learn More` with descriptive link text. Improve image alt text without keyword stuffing.



### FUT-024 ? FAQ and structured organization information



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** Partially complete (2026-08-26) ? merged to `master` 2026-08-27. Team Shot Tracker FAQ omitted (separate product policy)  

**Systems:** `/shoot/faq`, Organization + FAQPage JSON-LD  

**Evidence:** `web/app/(program)/faq/page.tsx`, `web/lib/seo/faq-content.ts`, `web/lib/seo/metadata.ts`



Add an appropriate FAQ and organization information where supported by the current website. Cover grades served, boys and girls, Educational Athletics, shooting challenge, XP/progress, video feedback, Team Shot Tracker, location, and registration. Add organization/local information only where accurate and privacy-safe.



### FUT-025 ? Sitemap, indexing, and public athlete profiles



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** **COMPLETE / Live Tested** (2026-09-04) ? Production athlete indexing cutover enabled (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ATHLETE_PROFILE_INDEXING=true`); privacy boundaries verified; sitemap still excludes athlete URLs  

**Systems:** Sitemap, robots, athlete profile metadata, consent assumptions

**Evidence:** [`docs/audits/FUT-025-indexing-cutover-20260904.md`](./audits/FUT-025-indexing-cutover-20260904.md) Ã‚Â· [`docs/testing/evidence/fut-025-indexing-cutover-20260904.json`](./testing/evidence/fut-025-indexing-cutover-20260904.json) Ã‚Â· deploy `dpl_4tbg25UzYPFruga1PzQthewWswNP`



Create or verify a sitemap and indexability rules for public pages. Public athlete profiles may be indexable using the athlete?s full name because registration consent covers name, image, and likeness promotion. The public profile may display:



- Full athlete name

- School

- Grade

- Approved progress information



Do not expose parent contact information, email addresses, private submission metadata, or sensitive information. The prompt must verify consent assumptions, route stability, metadata uniqueness, and search-engine behavior.



**Policy (live 2026-09-04):** Program listing pages indexable when `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_SEARCH_INDEXING=true`. Athlete profiles are **`index, follow`** when **both** program and athlete flags are true **and** the enrollment has Public Profile Enabled + unique Public Profile Slug. Missing/disabled profiles stay **`noindex`**. In-page profile HTML uses registration-consent allowlist only (`lib/data/public-athlete-profile.ts`, `PUBLIC_PROFILE_ENROLLMENT_FIELDS`). Metadata excludes grade/school via `buildAthleteProfilePageMetadata`. Sitemap intentionally excludes athlete slugs even after cutover (discovery via leaderboard links). `robots.txt` omits `/athletes/` from Disallow when the athlete cutover flag is enabled.



**Validation (2026-09-04):** Production robots/profile/sitemap checks Ã‚Â· `public-athlete-profile-privacy.test.ts` Ã‚Â· `athlete-profile-metadata.test.ts` Ã‚Â· `metadata.test.ts` Ã‚Â· `search-indexing.spec.ts` Ã‚Â· deploy checklist [`docs/deploy-checklists/2026-08-30-athlete-profile-indexing-cutover.md`](../docs/deploy-checklists/2026-08-30-athlete-profile-indexing-cutover.md)



### FUT-026 ? Final Player Manual before challenge launch



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** Deferred until final pre-launch phase  

**Systems:** Player Manual, Airtable configuration, website/app behavior



Keep the Player Manual on the future-work list, but complete it last?immediately before the challenge begins. The final manual must reflect the finished rules, homework deadline behavior, levels, XP, Perfect Week requirements, video feedback, Zoom options, website experience, and parent/athlete workflows.



Do not finalize or publish the manual while material app rules or page behavior are still changing.



### FUT-027 ? Program-wide gift card award commitment (parent FAQ)



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** **Complete** (2026-08-30) ? Mike-approved copy shipped on `/shoot/faq`  

**Systems:** FAQ content, parent registration expectations  

**Evidence:** `web/lib/seo/public-program-content.ts`, `web/lib/seo/faq-content.ts` (`gift-card-commitment`), `web/lib/seo/faq-content.test.ts`, `web/tests/national-seo.spec.ts`



Publish parent-facing wording that at least 100% of registration fees collected across the challenge will be distributed through gift cards, with recipients and amounts at the program director's discretion ? without implying refunds, guaranteed individual awards, or a fixed schedule.



### FUT-028 ? About the Coach (homepage)



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** **Complete** (2026-08-30) ? Mike-approved copy shipped on `/shoot#about-the-coach`  

**Systems:** Homepage parent trust section

Build a grade-band homework player inside the existing application. The defining integration component is the **Homework Intake Adapter**, which replaces only the athlete-facing intake method and must produce exactly one validated, canonical Homework Completion indistinguishable to downstream workflows from a correctly produced completion under the existing system.



**Locked product direction (2026-09-05):** preserve current PHA/scheduling activation; server-selected Enrollment grade band (never trust the browser); one-session completion with no user-facing draft workflow; immutable attempts; coach Satisfactory / Needs Revision; coach-authorized redo only; XP only after Satisfactory via existing Homework XP automation; paper/photo/video paths preserved until separately authorized migration; one award-bearing HC per Enrollment+PHA with child attempts.

**Summary:** Keep one Homework XP Event (base + extra credit total). When `Extra Credit XP Awarded` > 0, show a parent-visible tagline on the Game Log date row, e.g. `2026-08-31 Ã‚Â· Extra credit +125 XP`. Display-only ? no XP calculation or Airtable award-logic changes.



**Done (2026-08-31):** `game-log-presentation.ts` (`formatGameLogExtraCreditTagline`, `formatGameLogDateLine`, `dateTagline` on homework rows); `xp-activity-loader.ts` loads `Extra Credit XP Awarded`; `recent-activity-log.tsx` + `xp-activity-table.tsx` wire tagline to date row; `mapXpSummariesToPublicActivity` passes `dateTagline`.



**Tests:** `game-log-presentation.test.ts`, `recent-activity-log.test.ts`, `xp-activity-table.test.ts`, `xp-activity-loader.test.ts` ? **63/63 PASS** (2026-09-01 verify)



### FUT-032 ? Homework Completions Hub ? Resend source writeback (Parent Feedback Sent?)



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** **COMPLETE** (2026-08-31) ? Hub writeback live ([communications#42](https://github.com/Schmidt127/communications/pull/42) **MERGED**); Mike verified Parent Feedback Sent? + Sent On on Schmidt HC after 065/071 path  

**Systems:** Communications Hub, Resend webhooks, Homework Completions, Automation **071** / **079** (read-only for Sent?), Email Handoff Queue  

**Related:** FUT-006 Ã‚Â· Video Feedback Hub writeback ([`deploy-checklists/VIDEO-FEEDBACK-HUB-RESEND-WRITEBACK.md`](./deploy-checklists/VIDEO-FEEDBACK-HUB-RESEND-WRITEBACK.md)) Ã‚Â· [`online-agents/homework-assets/HOMEWORK-ASSET-COMPLETION-RUNBOOK.md`](./online-agents/homework-assets/HOMEWORK-ASSET-COMPLETION-RUNBOOK.md) Ã‚Â§7  

**Promotion:** [`deploy-checklists/FUT-032-homework-hub-resend-writeback.md`](./deploy-checklists/FUT-032-homework-hub-resend-writeback.md) Ã‚Â· Hub contract `communications/docs/contracts/HOMEWORK_FEEDBACK_SOURCE_WRITEBACK_v1.md`



**Problem:** After Hub cutover, homework parent emails send via **071 ? Email Handoff Queue ? 079 ? Hub ? Resend**, but Homework Completions **`Parent Feedback Sent?`** and **`Parent Feedback Sent On`** were never written. **071** correctly does **not** write them. Video Feedback already had Hub ? SC source writeback after Resend.



**Owner of Sent?:** Communications Hub after Resend success/failure (same pattern as Video). Not 071, not 079, not Make/Gmail, not S3/`Writeback Complete?`.



**Done (2026-08-31):**



1. Production HC fields created (Video parity): Delivery Status, Delivery Error, Hub Event ID, Resend Message ID.

2. Hub: `source-writeback-homework-feedback.js`; wired in `welcome-processor.js` + `resend-webhook.js`; tests `homework-feedback-writeback.test.mjs`; **PR #42 merged** to `communications` `main`.

3. SC docs/checklist updated.

4. Mike verified live: **Parent Feedback Sent?** checked and **Parent Feedback Sent On** correct after homework feedback send (Athlete1 / Meditation Workout path). Related: Production **065 v10.5** paste (points reconcile) same day.



**Out of scope:** `Completion Status` / `Satisfactory?` / XP / S3 upload writeback; historical backfill of pre-writeback sends.

## H. Approved brainstorming intake ? 2026-08-31



Owner-approved product/UX/infrastructure items captured below as **FUT-033?FUT-048**. Documentation-only intake; **do not implement from this section alone** ? convert each item to a Phase 2 brief before code, schema, Fillout, or Production changes. Do not reopen completed **FUT-018** / **FUT-019** / **FUT-010** as duplicates; new IDs own the new scope and cross-reference related work.



**Repo routing:** Club marketing root / ?More than a Scoreboard? / Upcoming Programs (**FUT-033?FUT-037**) ? implement in **`hoopchallenges-landing`** (Fairfield Basketball Club landing). Shooting Challenge app, Airtable, Hub email, Fillout SC forms, and S3 pipeline items (**FUT-038?FUT-048**) ? this repo and linked systems unless noted.



### FUT-033 ? Correct ?More than a Scoreboard? Youth Programs vs Coach Tools copy



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** **COMPLETE** (2026-09-01) â€” landing Youth Programs vs Coach Tools copy shipped; live audit corrections applied same day.  

**Systems:** Club landing / public website copy  

**Correct repo:** `hoopchallenges-landing` (local clone `127si-landing-page`; not `/shoot` in this repo)  

**Related:** FUT-034 Â· FUT-036 Â· SC-149 Â· [CURRENT-TRUTH.md](./CURRENT-TRUTH.md) Â§ Website Â· Mike-approved naming taxonomy above Â· [`audits/2026-09-01-FUT-033-047-LIVE-REMAINING-AUDIT.md`](./audits/2026-09-01-FUT-033-047-LIVE-REMAINING-AUDIT.md)



**Problem:** The ?More than a Scoreboard? Q&A does not clearly distinguish Youth Programs from Coach Tools, and must not use ?Youth opportunities.?



**Approved requirements:**



- **Youth Programs:** Shooting Challenge, Dribbling Challenge, Jr. Referee Clinic  

- **Coach Tools:** Brackets, Team Shot Tracker, State Rankings  

- Proposed copy: ?Youth programs include Shooting Challenge, Dribbling Challenge, and Jr. Referee Clinic. Coach tools are also available, including Brackets, Team Shot Tracker, and State Rankings.?  

- Use **?Youth Programs?** consistently; do not use ?Youth opportunities.?



**Dependencies / risks:** Copy must stay consistent with FUT-034 naming and FUT-036 program cards. Landing repo ownership ? do not edit this repo?s `web/` for this item unless Mike confirms the content also lives under `/shoot`.



**Decisions still open:** Exact heading/Q wording beyond the approved distinction sentence; whether `/shoot` FAQ or homepage needs a parallel correction.



### FUT-034 ? Standardize ?Jr. Referee Clinic? naming everywhere



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** **COMPLETE** (2026-09-01) â€” Jr. Referee Clinic naming shipped on landing; Section G overlay authoritative.

**Systems:** Public website, emails, Fillout forms, documentation, user-facing copy (cross-repo)  

**Correct repos:** `hoopchallenges-landing` + this repo (`web/`, Hub templates, docs) + Fillout + Jr. Referee Clinic product surfaces where the public name must match  

**Related:** FUT-033 Ã‚Â· FUT-036 Ã‚Â· Mike-approved naming taxonomy above Ã‚Â· SC-143 (multi-challenge ? do not merge)



**Problem:** Short or incorrect names (especially **Jr. Ref**) weaken brand consistency across public surfaces.



**Approved requirements:**



- Preferred: **Jr. Referee Clinic**  

- Acceptable when space is limited: **Jr. Ref Clinic**  

- Never: **Jr. Ref**  

- Search and correct incorrect uses across public website, emails, forms, documentation, and other user-facing copy.



**Dependencies / risks:** Broader than landing-only; coordinate with the Jr. Referee Clinic product repo (`127-si-jr-ref`) only where that product?s public name must match ? do not pull JR Ref implementation into this repo.



**Decisions still open:** Inventory of live Fillout form titles and email subjects that still use the banned short form **Jr. Ref**; whether internal/admin-only labels may keep a shorter form.



### FUT-035 ? Replace navy-blue landing treatments with royal blue / orange brand system



**Priority:** P2  

**Status:** **COMPLETE** (2026-09-01) â€” landing navyâ†’brand blue shipped; Section G overlay authoritative.

**Systems:** Club landing visual design (header, ?More than a Scoreboard,? related image/content section; footer already brand blue)  

**Correct repo:** `hoopchallenges-landing`  

**Related:** FUT-019 (SC site footer ? **COMPLETE**, separate app) Ã‚Â· SC-149 Ã‚Â· `BRAND_STANDARDS.md` (sync check vs landing canonical brand doc)



**Problem:** Navy-blue treatment in the landing header, ?More than a Scoreboard? section, related image/content section, and footer does not match the royal blue / orange brand system.



**Approved requirements:**



- Replace navy with a professional treatment based on existing **royal blue and orange** branding.  

- Prefer a royal-blue-based color or gradient matching the header.  

- Footer must use the same blue/header color system rather than navy.



**Dependencies / risks:** Brand doc version mismatch between landing and this repo ? synchronize through approved cross-repo documentation update; do not invent a third palette.



**Decisions still open:** Exact hex/CSS tokens; whether SC `/shoot` chrome needs any parallel navy cleanup (out of scope unless found during audit).



### FUT-036 ? Redesign Upcoming Programs section (six differentiated program cards)



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** **COMPLETE** (2026-09-01) â€” six Upcoming Programs cards shipped; Section G overlay authoritative.

**Systems:** Club landing Upcoming Programs UI  

**Correct repo:** `hoopchallenges-landing`  

**Related:** FUT-033 Ã‚Â· FUT-034 Ã‚Â· FUT-037 Ã‚Â· SC-143



**Problem:** Current three identical white boxes are visually weak and do not present all six offerings or Youth Programs vs Coach Tools.



**Approved requirements:**



- Completely redesign Upcoming Programs with attractive, clearly differentiated program cards.  

- Each card supports: program image, program name, short description, category label, availability/status, clear CTA, consistent but engaging design.  

- Include all six: Shooting Challenge, Dribbling Challenge, Jr. Referee Clinic, Brackets, Team Shot Tracker, State Rankings.  

- Clearly distinguish **Youth Programs** from **Coach Tools**.



**Dependencies / risks:** FUT-037 images; FUT-034 naming; CTA destinations and availability status per program (**decision needed** per offering).



**Decisions still open:** Per-program CTA URLs/status copy; card layout breakpoints; whether Coach Tools share the same card component with different category chrome only.



### FUT-037 ? Youth Programs / program cards: replace solid panels with images



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** **COMPLETE** (2026-09-01) ? Program images live at `/images/programs/*.jpg` (HTTP 200 per live audit)  

**Systems:** Club landing program imagery  

**Correct repo:** `hoopchallenges-landing`  

**Asset directory (landing):** `/public/images/programs/`  

**Related:** FUT-036



**Problem:** Solid-color panels in the Youth Programs (and related program) section should be real imagery.



**Approved requirements:**



- Replace solid-color panels with images supplied by Mike.  

- Recommended filenames: `shooting-challenge.jpg`, `dribbling-challenge.jpg`, `jr-referee-clinic.jpg`, `brackets.jpg`, `team-shot-tracker.jpg`, `state-standings.jpg`.  

- Consistent dimensions, cropping, overlays, accessibility text, and responsive behavior.



**Dependencies / risks:** Image supply and licensing; FUT-036 card redesign should define slots before final crop specs.



**Decisions still open:** Final image dimensions/aspect ratio; overlay treatment; alt-text source of truth.



### FUT-038 ? Global configurable program-category on/off system



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** **Brief Needed** ? decision worksheet ready; **do not implement** schema/automation/web/email until Mike replies and PKG-004 approves fields  

**Brief:** [next-wave/config-selection/FUT-038-GLOBAL-CATEGORY-ONOFF-BRIEF.md](./next-wave/config-selection/FUT-038-GLOBAL-CATEGORY-ONOFF-BRIEF.md)  

**Worksheet:** [next-wave/config-selection/FUT-038-MIKE-DECISION-WORKSHEET.md](./next-wave/config-selection/FUT-038-MIKE-DECISION-WORKSHEET.md) (**12** decisions; reply `1D, 2A, ?`)  

**Systems:** Airtable Config / Program Instance (or equivalent), XP, levels/gates, GOAT, achievements, milestones, weekly summaries, parent/athlete emails, website progress displays, related automations  

**Correct repo:** this repo (+ Production Airtable after approved design)  

**Related:** SC-034 / config-over-code Ã‚Â· C-014 / SC-082 gate tuning Ã‚Â· FUT-026 Player Manual Ã‚Â· PKG-004 Ã‚Â· [v2/03-business-rules.md](./v2/03-business-rules.md) Ã‚Â· [next-wave/config-selection/CONFIG-CONSUMER-INVENTORY.md](./next-wave/config-selection/CONFIG-CONSUMER-INVENTORY.md) Ã‚Â· [CURRENT-TRUTH.md](./CURRENT-TRUTH.md) Ã‚Â§ XP / levels



**Problem:** Coaches need to disable whole participation categories for a program instance/season without breaking XP, levels, GOAT, achievements, or communications.



**Initial categories (extensible):** Submissions, Homework, Video Feedback, Zoom, Streaks, Achievements, Milestones, and any other existing XP/progression category that should be configurable.



**Approved requirements:**



- Global category on/off per program instance or season.  

- When a category is disabled (example: Homework off), participants must still: earn XP appropriately; move through all levels; meet **adjusted** gates; earn achievements where applicable; reach **GOAT**; receive accurate progress displays and communications.  

- **Disabled categories must not block GOAT progression** or accidentally block level advancement.  

- Auto-adjust: XP calculations, level gates, GOAT requirements, achievement requirements, progress/status displays, weekly summaries, parent emails, athlete emails, related automations / success calculations.  

- Extensible configuration so new categories can be added later without redesigning the architecture.  

- Safe defaults; administrative visibility; clear documentation.  

- Testing with Homework **enabled** and **disabled**.  

- Protection against disabled categories accidentally blocking progression.



**Dependencies / risks:** Large cross-cutting change ? schema ownership gate (PKG-004), automation inventory, email templates, web loaders. High regression risk if gates remain hard-required for disabled categories.



**Decisions still open (do not invent):** Which Airtable table owns the flags (Config vs Program Instance vs new table); default on/off per category for 2026?27; how Perfect Week / recorded Zoom interact when Zoom or Homework is off; whether website hides disabled category UI entirely or shows ?not part of this season.?



### FUT-039 ? Fillout.com branding and CSS consistency (planning only)



**Priority:** P2  

**Status:** **COMPLETE** (2026-09-01) ? Mike attested Fillout CSS styling complete  

**Brief:** [FUT-039-FILLOUT-BRANDING-BRIEF.md](./next-wave/fillout/FUT-039-FILLOUT-BRANDING-BRIEF.md)  

**CSS artifact:** [fillout-theme-sc-2026.css](./next-wave/fillout/fillout-theme-sc-2026.css)  

**Inventory:** [FILLOUT-FORM-INVENTORY.md](./next-wave/fillout/FILLOUT-FORM-INVENTORY.md) (**12 rows**; **5** v1 in-scope surfaces)  

**Systems:** Fillout forms (registration, homework, and related SC forms)  

**Correct repo / surface:** Fillout.com + docs in this repo; coordinate with FUT-003 / FUT-029 (deferred in-app homework platform â€” theme inheritance only if any Fillout homework fallback remains)  

**Related:** FUT-003 Ã‚Â· FUT-029 Ã‚Â· FUT-034 Ã‚Â· FUT-035 Ã‚Â· SC-060 / SC-146



**Problem:** Related Fillout forms lack a consistent 127 SI / Fairfield branding treatment.



**Approved requirements (planning item):**



- Standardize header treatment, royal-blue/orange palette, typography, buttons, fields, spacing, logo/program identification, confirmation screens.  

- Produce an implementation brief and form inventory before any live Fillout CSS/theme changes.



**Brief deliverables (2026-09-01):** Form inventory; current vs target brand alignment (`BRAND_STANDARDS.md`, FUT-035 royal blue); Fillout theme/CSS capability research; v1 scope (registration + daily + edit submission); risk matrix (FUT-003, SC-060, FUT-029); Phase 3 slices; **12** Mike decisions **locked**; PKG/promotion requirements; operator checklist + CSS artifact.



**Mike decisions (2026-09-01):** Option A shared theme; repo CSS file; `web/public/brand/` logos; Mike applies in Fillout; v1 trio only; edit URL ? `shoot-editsubmission` custom domain + formula update; per-form theme (not org default); logo+text header; Maven Pro only; Fillout ending (no redirect); branding before FUT-003; OMNI Jr. Ref title audit.



### FUT-040 ? Automatic S3 migration for homework, video-feedback, and headshot attachments



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** **Brief Needed** ? Phase 2 brief ready; Phase 3 blocked on Mike decisions + PKG-004  

**Brief:** [FUT-040-AUTOMATIC-S3-MIGRATION-BRIEF.md](./next-wave/s3-migration/FUT-040-AUTOMATIC-S3-MIGRATION-BRIEF.md)  

**Systems:** Airtable attachments, AWS S3, Lambda viewer (where applicable), Submission Assets / registration headshots, audit/status fields  

**Correct repo:** this repo + AWS  

**Related:** **FUT-010** (intake SA cleanup after verified upload ? dry-run complete; supervised apply pending) Ã‚Â· FUT-007 (HEADSHOT naming) Ã‚Â· FUT-009 Ã‚Â· SC-094 Ã‚Â· SC-095 Ã‚Â· SC-096 Ã‚Â· SC-099 Ã‚Â· SC-100 Ã‚Â· [deploy-checklists/FUT-010-intake-attachment-cleanup.md](./deploy-checklists/FUT-010-intake-attachment-cleanup.md) Ã‚Â· [CURRENT-TRUTH.md](./CURRENT-TRUTH.md) FUT-010 row



**Problem:** Need an automatic migration path that copies approved attachment categories to S3, verifies access, preserves the S3 URL, then deletes the Airtable attachment ? including headshots collected at registration ? without expanding to unapproved attachment types.



**Scope (only these categories unless separately approved):**



1. Homework files  

2. Video files for feedback  

3. Headshots collected during registration  



**Required order:**



1. Copy the file to AWS S3.  

2. Confirm that the S3 object exists.  

3. Confirm that the stored link works and is accessible to the authorized user.  

4. Preserve the verified S3 URL.  

5. Automatically delete the original Airtable attachment.  



**Hard rule:** S3 / Airtable attachment deletion occurs **only after successful verification** (steps 1?4). Never delete the S3 object as part of this cleanup. Never delete the Airtable record.



**Before automatic deletion is enabled, require:** migration status, verification status, error handling, audit trail, retry or exception handling, and a test using non-production records or an approved test process.



**Dependencies / risks:** FUT-010 already covers verified cleanup for homework-route and video-route **Submission Assets**; this item adds **automatic migration orchestration**, **headshots**, and explicit status/audit fields. Do not run destructive apply until verification gates pass. Public S3 bucket remains **rejected** (Section E).



**Decisions still open:** Headshot source field/table on Athletes/Enrollments; whether FUT-010 CLI becomes a worker inside this pipeline or remains a separate supervised tool; Lambda viewer applicability for headshots vs homework/video.



### FUT-041 ? Daily Submission Acknowledgement email: XP in horizontal columns



**Priority:** P2  

**Status:** **COMPLETE** (2026-09-01) ? **076 v8.12** Production + Hub **FUT-041** template. Paste queue empty.  

**Systems:** Daily Submission Acknowledgement email (Hub / Resend; automation **076** path)  

**Correct repo:** this repo + Communications Hub templates  

**Related:** FUT-006 Ã‚Â· FUT-031 Ã‚Â· [integrations/email-send-plane.md](./integrations/email-send-plane.md) Ã‚Â· [CURRENT-TRUTH.md](./CURRENT-TRUTH.md) Ã‚Â§ Email path Ã‚Â· `docs/communications-hub/`



**Problem:** XP presentation in the Daily Submission Acknowledgement email should show earned XP and extra credit in clear horizontal columns.



**Approved requirements:**



- Display XP in horizontal columns with headings **XP Earned** and **Extra Credit**.  

- **Always** display the Extra Credit column.  

- Display **0** when no extra credit is awarded.  

- Example: XP Earned `10` Ã‚Â· Extra Credit `0`.



**Shipped (2026-09-01):** **076 v8.12** sends `xpEarned` (active `SUBMISSION_XP|` total) and `xpExtraCredit` (`0` until stored daily extra-credit source exists). Hub `DAILY_SUBMISSION` template renders horizontal columns. Display-time split only ? no XP award logic change. Checklist: [`docs/deploy-checklists/FUT-041-daily-submission-xp-columns.md`](./deploy-checklists/FUT-041-daily-submission-xp-columns.md).



### FUT-042 ? Style Coach Feedback as a quotation (emails + website cards)



**Priority:** P2  

**Status:** **COMPLETE** (2026-09-01) ? SC web `CoachFeedbackQuote` + Hub homework/video quotation styling deployed.  

**Systems:** Parent-facing emails; website/dashboard homework (and related) cards  

**Correct repo:** this repo (`web/` + Hub email HTML)  

**Related:** FUT-043 Ã‚Â· FUT-032 Ã‚Â· Automation **071** / homework feedback templates Ã‚Â· `web/lib/data/public-athlete-homework.ts` (`Coach Feedback`)



**Problem:** Coach Feedback reads as plain body text rather than a clear quotation.



**Approved requirements:**



- Indented block; smaller font; italic text; orange left border; light blue-gray background; consistent padding; accessible color contrast.  

- Apply in both parent-facing emails and website/dashboard cards.



**Dependencies / risks:** Shared design tokens with FUT-043; contrast check against brand orange/blue.



**Shipped (2026-09-01):** `CoachFeedbackQuote` web component + Hub `coach-feedback-quote.js` in homework and video feedback emails. Orange left border, light blue-gray background, italic; hidden when empty.



### FUT-043 ? Consistent card design system (website + emails)



**Priority:** P2  

**Status:** **COMPLETE** (2026-09-11) — web surfaces re-verified; Hub mirror reference in `docs/communications-hub/card-tokens-mirror-reference.js`  

**Systems:** Relevant website components and email cards  

**Correct repo:** this repo  

**Related:** FUT-042 Ã‚Â· FUT-044 Ã‚Â· FUT-011?FUT-017 design patterns Ã‚Â· Impeccable / `BRAND_STANDARDS.md` Ã‚Â· `APP_CONTEXT.md`



**Problem:** Cards across website and email surfaces are visually inconsistent.



**Approved requirements:** Standardize card heading size, font/weight, spacing, border/outline, corner radius, background colors, accent colors, internal padding, and responsive behavior across relevant website components and emails.



**Shipped (2026-09-01):** Web tokens in `globals.css`, helpers in `components/ui/sc-card.tsx`, applied to homework rows, Game Log, XP activity, catalog panels. Hub mirror in `card-tokens.js`. Doc: [`web/docs/sc-card-design-tokens.md`](../web/docs/sc-card-design-tokens.md).



**Decisions still open:** Token source of truth (CSS variables vs Hub partials); whether email HTML can share the same radius/border language as the web app.



### FUT-044 ? Remove redundant Submitted Work card; keep View Submitted Homework CTA



**Priority:** P2  

**Status:** **COMPLETE** (2026-09-01)  

**Systems:** Website athlete/parent homework UI  

**Correct repo:** this repo (`web/`)  

**Related:** FUT-043 Ã‚Â· FUT-014 Ã‚Â· athlete homework presentation components



**Problem:** A Submitted Work card is redundant when the View Submitted Homework action already covers the need.



**Approved requirements:** Remove the redundant Submitted Work card; keep the **View Submitted Homework** button.



**Shipped (2026-09-01):** Inventory found no prior Submitted Work card in `web/` (never implemented). Athlete profile homework rows (`HomeworkAssignments`) now expose only a **View Submitted Homework** external CTA when a safe lambda reviewer URL is present ? no inline submitted-work preview card. Data: Homework Completions `Submission Asset: Reviewer File URL (lookup)`.



**Validation:** `web` lint ? Ã‚Â· typecheck ? Ã‚Â· vitest homework-assignment + public-athlete-homework tests ?



### FUT-045 ? Use ?Assignment Name? (not ?Full Assignment Name?) in public-facing UI



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** **COMPLETE** (2026-09-01) ? PR **#319** merged `de21fa36`; prod verified on `/shoot/athletes/athlete1-schmidt`  

**Systems:** Website cards, emails, assignment details, parent-facing displays  

**Correct repo:** this repo (+ Hub email payloads)  

**Related:** FUT-001 Ã‚Â· FUT-014 Ã‚Â· chatgpt-sources platform-config notes on public assignment naming Ã‚Â· Homework Library / PHA field map



**Problem:** Public surfaces expose ?Full Assignment Name? (or equivalent long/internal labels) instead of parent-friendly **Assignment Name**.



**Approved requirements:** Use **Assignment Name** instead of **Full Assignment Name** in all public-facing components: website cards, emails, assignment details, parent-facing displays.



**Shipped (2026-09-01):** `resolvePublicAssignmentName()` in `web/lib/data/homework.ts` ? precedence **Assignment Title** ? `Assignment Full Name - Display` ? `Assignment Full Name`. Applied to homework catalog, athlete profile rows, homework detail view, and page SEO titles. FUT-001 identity matching unchanged (IDs only). Hub emails still pending FUT-046.



**Dependencies / risks:** Confirm Airtable field that is the canonical public Assignment Name vs formula/primary full name; do not break FUT-001 identity matching (internal identity may still use stable IDs / library keys).



### FUT-046 ? Homework feedback email subject: name + Assignment Name



**Priority:** P2  

**Status:** **COMPLETE** (2026-09-01) ? **071 v4.3** Production + Hub subject builder. Paste queue empty.  

**Systems:** Homework feedback email subject (Hub / **071** payload or Hub template)  

**Correct repo:** this repo + Communications Hub  

**Related:** FUT-032 Ã‚Â· FUT-045 Ã‚Â· FUT-047 Ã‚Â· `docs/communications-hub/README.md`



**Problem:** Homework feedback subject line should identify athlete and assignment clearly.



**Approved requirements:** Subject format:



`Homework Feedback ? First Name Last Name ? Assignment Name`



**Shipped (2026-09-01):** Hub builds subject in `template-candidate-renderer.js`; `[TEST]` prefix when `testMode: true`. **071 v4.3** sends `assignmentTitle`, `athleteFirstName`, `athleteLastName`. Checklist: [`docs/deploy-checklists/FUT-046-homework-feedback-subject.md`](./deploy-checklists/FUT-046-homework-feedback-subject.md).



### FUT-047 ? Homework feedback contact: monitored Fairfield address (not unmonitored reply)



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** **COMPLETE** (2026-09-01) ? Hub homework feedback contact copy deployed.  

**Systems:** Homework feedback (and any related) parent email copy  

**Correct repo:** this repo + Communications Hub templates  

**Related:** FUT-046 Ã‚Â· FUT-006 Ã‚Â· email send plane docs



**Problem:** Current instruction tells recipients to reply to an unmonitored notification address.



**Approved requirements:**



- Use monitored contact: **schmidt@fairfieldbasketballclub.com**  

- Recommended wording: ?Questions about this feedback? Please contact us at schmidt@fairfieldbasketballclub.com.?  

- Do not instruct parents to reply to the unmonitored notification address for feedback questions.



**Shipped (2026-09-01):** Hub `HOMEWORK_FEEDBACK` template footer updated; `mailto:` link on address. Reply-To / From headers unchanged. Homework-only v1 (video/welcome copy unchanged). Checklist: [`docs/deploy-checklists/FUT-047-homework-feedback-contact-copy.md`](./deploy-checklists/FUT-047-homework-feedback-contact-copy.md).

### FUT-048 â€” CloudFront Custom Domain for Homework Resources



**Priority:** P3 (Optional / low)  

**Status:** **DEFERRED** â€” optional branding and infrastructure; **not a launch blocker**; **do not implement now**  

**Type:** Branding and infrastructure  

**Systems:** AWS S3 (`resources-homework`), CloudFront (`resources-homework-cf`), DNS / ACM, Airtable homework resource URLs, website homework links  

**Correct repo:** this repo + AWS / DNS (when separately authorized)  

**Related:** SC-162 durable homework links Â· Homework Library resource URLs Â· **not** FUT-029 Â· **not** FUT-040 athlete-attachment migration



**Current truth (acceptable as-is):**



- S3 bucket: **`resources-homework`**

- CloudFront distribution: **`resources-homework-cf`**

- Permanent CloudFront domain: **`d21ixrrrqpqz29.cloudfront.net`**

- Current CloudFront URLs are **acceptable** for Airtable and Production use.



**Future objective (optional):** Replace the CloudFront-provided domain with a branded hostname such as **`homework.fairfieldbasketballclub.com`**.



**Future work (when authorized â€” documentation only until then):**



1. Obtain or validate an ACM TLS certificate.

2. Add the custom domain to the CloudFront distribution.

3. Create the required DNS record.

4. Verify HTTPS and PDF delivery.

5. Decide whether existing Airtable URLs should be migrated.

6. Test website homework links.

7. Preserve the existing **`*.cloudfront.net`** domain as a fallback.

8. Document rollback.



**Hard constraints for this backlog item:**



- **No custom-domain work is required now.**

- Do **not** change CloudFront, DNS, S3, Airtable, or Production under this ID until separately authorized.

- Existing CloudFront URLs remain valid.

- Do **not** delay current homework-resource migration for this cosmetic improvement.

- This item **does not belong to FUT-029** implementation.



**Acceptance (future):** Branded HTTPS domain serves homework PDFs; `cloudfront.net` fallback preserved; Airtable/web migration decision documented; rollback documented; no surprise breakage of existing links.

### SC-ATHLETE-WF-001 ? Individual athlete workflow QA (pre?season simulation)



**Priority:** P0  

**Status:** COMPLETE (harness) ? **MRW-I13 closed** (Submission XP once per Count It submission); 065 Satisfactory-alone is expected skip  

**Systems:** Testing harness, Enrollments (Testing3), Submissions, WAS, Homework Completions, Video Feedback, XP Events, streaks/levels contracts  

**Related (distinct):** SC-005 matrix Ã‚Â· **SC-PW-E2E** (COMPLETE ? do not re-`--apply`) Ã‚Â· **SC-SEASON-SIM-001/002** Ã‚Â· **SC-CORE-WF / MRW-F11** (COMPLETE) Ã‚Â· MRW-F09



Prove the **single disposable athlete** path end-to-end before any multi-enrollment season simulation: enrollment ? submissions (same-day / backdate / multi / Count It / Simple Total via Shot Total) ? XP dedupe ? homework/video ? streaks/levels expectations ? WAS rollups ? negatives ? replay.



**Safety:** `ATHWF|` Week labels Ã‚Â· Testing3 `recNu6fcBpF1GG3u5` only Ã‚Â· dry-run default Ã‚Â· no email / Resend / Make Ã‚Â· cleanup only manifest records.



**Plan / harness / evidence:** [`docs/testing/athlete-workflow/SC-ATHLETE-WF.md`](./testing/athlete-workflow/SC-ATHLETE-WF.md) Ã‚Â· `tools/testing/sc-athlete-wf.mjs` Ã‚Â· [`docs/testing/evidence/sc-athlete-wf/apply-session-final-2026-08-30.json`](./testing/evidence/sc-athlete-wf/apply-session-final-2026-08-30.json)



**Disposition (2026-08-30):** SC-005 B3 same-day multi SUBMISSION_XP is **expected** (once per Count It). Satisfactory HC without PHA does not fire 065 (expected skip). Agent PAT DELETE XP Events remains best-effort/MCP. Leave uncommitted `sc-pw-e2e-lib` formula-field WIP untouched.



### SC-SEASON-SIM-001 â€” Three-Athlete Full-Season Simulation



**Priority:** P1  

**Status:** **READY — three-athlete NOT EXECUTED** (2026-09-14). Perfect Mike Schmidt path **COMPLETE** (SEASON-SIM-PERFECT-20260914T202231Z-mike-schmidt, pre-restore **4980 / 170**). Cascade-fix era notes remain historical — see [udits/SC-SEASON-SIM-001-CASCADE-FAILURE-20260906.md](./audits/SC-SEASON-SIM-001-CASCADE-FAILURE-20260906.md). Perfect pass: [udits/readiness-20260914/FINAL-PASS-SEASON-SIM-PERFECT-20260914T202231Z-mike-schmidt.md](./audits/readiness-20260914/FINAL-PASS-SEASON-SIM-PERFECT-20260914T202231Z-mike-schmidt.md)

**Systems:** `tools/season_simulation/`, Enrollments, Submissions, Homework Completions, Video Feedback, Zoom, WAS, XP Events, streaks, milestones, Perfect Week, weekly email stage (SC-168), Hub allowlist  

**Related (distinct):** **SC-SEASON-SIM-002** (COMPLETE historical single-athlete package â€” do not rerun T122531Z) Â· SC-167/168/169 (COMPLETE) Â· **FUT-010** separate Â· **FUT-029** deferred Â· **SC-112** three-athlete auth (distinct â€” parent multi-child select, not season sim)



Reusable **three-athlete** full-season simulation (May 1 â€“ June 30, 2027) proving success **and** failure branches together:



| Athlete | Profile | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Sim Perfect | `athlete1_perfect` | Maximum compliance â€” daily submissions, all homework, â‰¥3 videos/week, all Perfect Weeks, all reachable milestones |
| Sim Recovery | `athlete2_recovery` | Missed days, broken streaks, mixed homework/video/Zoom, one late Perfect Week |
| Sim Edge | `athlete3_edge` | Timing, idempotency, PW failure modes, late homework XP without retro PW |



**Package (repo):** `scenarios_sc001.py`, `expectations_matrix.py`, `three_athlete.py`, CLI `dry-run-three`  

**Manifest:** [`deploy-checklists/SC-SEASON-SIM-001-EXECUTION-MANIFEST.md`](./deploy-checklists/SC-SEASON-SIM-001-EXECUTION-MANIFEST.md)  

**Operator:** [`deploy-checklists/SC-SEASON-SIM-001-operator-checklist.md`](./deploy-checklists/SC-SEASON-SIM-001-operator-checklist.md)  

**Matrix:** [`deploy-checklists/SC-SEASON-SIM-001-SCENARIO-MATRIX.md`](./deploy-checklists/SC-SEASON-SIM-001-SCENARIO-MATRIX.md)  

**Readiness audit:** [`audits/SC-SEASON-SIM-001-THREE-ATHLETE-PREP-READINESS-20260906.md`](./audits/SC-SEASON-SIM-001-THREE-ATHLETE-PREP-READINESS-20260906.md)



**Authorization:** Mike must say exactly **`RUN 3-ATHLETE SEASON SIMULATION`** plus CLI confirm gates (`--confirm-three-athlete`, `--authorization-phrase`). Execute **NOT authorized** until Mike explicitly authorizes.



**Historical note:** Prior five-enrollment design is **superseded** by this three-athlete package (2026-09-06). Do not implement five-enrollment paths.



**Acceptance (live execute â€” future):** Three disposable athletes created under a new run ID; cascade matches precomputed expectation matrices; allowlist email only; pre-restore acceptance captured before Production-normal formula restore; cleanup separately authorized and verified.



**Do not:** Create DEV base; rerun SC-SEASON-SIM-002 T122531Z; install 122; implement FUT-029; confuse with SC-161 leaderboard "3 athletes" or SC-112 multi-child auth.



### SC-168 â€” Missing Weekly Email Handoffs (Season Sim expectation)

**Priority:** P1  
**Status:** **CORRECTED EXPECTATION + STAGE SHIPPED (repo)** â€” 2026-09-05  
**Systems:** Season Sim harness; 118 â†’ 072 â†’ 119 â†’ 074 â†’ Hub  
**Related:** SC-SEASON-SIM-002; T122531Z discrepancy #2  

**Finding:** Controlled run `SEASON-SIM-2027-20260905T122531Z-athlete1` produced **0** `WEEKLY_ATHLETE_SUMMARY` Hub handoffs while arming **6** Build Weekly flags and accepting **69** other emails to the allowlist. Prior T213135Z showed **6 WEEKLY Accepted** only after an explicit Send-to-Make arm (119 substitute).

**Classification:** **EXPECTED_BEHAVIOR_HARNESS_GAP** â€” not a Production 072/118/119/074 logic defect. Simulation clock does not fire Sunday cron (118/119). Execute `--enable-email-delivery` arms Build Weekly only.

**Repo fix:** `expectations_weekly_email.py` + `weekly_email_stage` CLI (plan/verify/apply) + tests. Audit: [`audits/SC-168-WEEKLY-EMAIL-HANDOFFS-20260905.md`](./audits/SC-168-WEEKLY-EMAIL-HANDOFFS-20260905.md). Checklist: [`deploy-checklists/SC-168-weekly-email-stage.md`](./deploy-checklists/SC-168-weekly-email-stage.md).

**Live proof:** N/A on cleaned T122531Z graph (0 Ready WAS with Enrollment). Historical T213135Z proved WEEKLY after Send-arm. Optional later: `weekly-email-stage` (limit 1, allowlist only). **No Production paste.**

**Do not:** Change Sunday schedules; force Send to Make inside execute by default; send to families.



### SC-SEASON-SIM-002 ? Athlete 1 Season Simulation Infrastructure (May?June 2027)



**Priority:** P2  

**Status:** **COMPLETE / historical package** (2026-09-05) â€” controlled runs were cleaned and formulas were restored. The dated SC-002 manifest is retained for evidence only; it is **not** the current execution procedure. Future Perfect runs use [`deploy-checklists/SC-SEASON-SIM-PERFECT-OPERATOR-GUIDE.md`](./deploy-checklists/SC-SEASON-SIM-PERFECT-OPERATOR-GUIDE.md) with a new run ID and explicit authorization.

**Systems:** `tools/season_simulation/`, Airtable gated formulas (temporary), automations 010/114/073/053/055/057/072, Hub Test Allowlist  

**Related (distinct):** **SC-SEASON-SIM-001** (three-athlete reusable package â€” **READY**, not executed; supersedes five-enrollment design)



Build reusable Python infrastructure for a full **Athlete 1** season simulation against Production (no DEV base; app not live to families):



- Window: **2027-05-01 through 2027-06-30 inclusive** (61 calendar days)

- Athlete: **Athlete 1**, Grade **12**, highest configured Grade 12 / 9?12 shot goal (runtime resolve)

- Modes: **preflight**, default **dry-run**, gated **execute**, gated **cleanup**

- Writer: HC `Submission Date`, WAS Grade Band at create, disposable 2027 Zoom Meetings, VF Feedback Posted? arm

- Automations: dual-gated Season Sim path in **010 / 114 / 073** (`Season Sim Test Record?` + `Video Upload Note` contains `SEASON-SIM|` ? compare to `Season Sim Clock Now`)

- Emails: off by default; Hub Test Allowlist must include `schmidt@fairfieldbasketballclub.com` (row `recLxwQnjM6gpfVc9` added 2026-09-02)

- Success = records **and** live automation cascade (XP / streaks / achievements / levels / WAS / Perfect Week / email handoffs)



**Hard constraints:** Do not create 121; do not modify 101 / SC-147 / 117 unless a proven sim defect requires it; no family emails; temporary formulas stay until a successful run then restore.



**Acceptance (next execute):** Paste 010/114/073 ? new run ID ? poll cascade ? verify ? cleanup ? restore formulas.



**Paste packets:** [`SC-SEASON-SIM-002-automation-paste-010-114.md`](./deploy-checklists/SC-SEASON-SIM-002-automation-paste-010-114.md) Ã‚Â· operator checklist Ã‚Â· `tools/season_simulation/FORMULAS-TO-PASTE.txt`

### SC-167 â€” Duplicate Submission XP (Season Sim T122531Z follow-up)

**Priority:** P0  
**Status:** **COMPLETE / Live Tested** (2026-09-05) â€” Live **010 v10.14** Option A create+retry proof  
**Systems:** Automation **010** v10.14, XP Events, Season Simulation harness  
**Related:** SC-SEASON-SIM-002 closeout discrepancies  

**Classification:** Confirmed Production TOCTOU defect in 010 create path (amplified by Season Sim Enrollment clear/restore). Fix: deterministic canonical Source Key ownership + post-create consolidate; ambiguous ownership fails closed. Evidence [`audits/SC-167-DUPLICATE-SUBMISSION-XP-20260905.md`](./audits/SC-167-DUPLICATE-SUBMISSION-XP-20260905.md).

### SC-168 â€” Missing Weekly Email Handoffs (Season Sim T122531Z follow-up)

**Priority:** P0  
**Status:** **COMPLETE / Corrected expectation** (2026-09-05)  
**Systems:** Automations **072 / 074 / 079 / 118 / 119**, WAS, Email Handoff Queue, Season Simulation writer  
**Related:** SC-SEASON-SIM-002  

Zero `WEEKLY_ATHLETE_SUMMARY` Hub handoffs after execute alone is **expected** (Build arm only; 118/119 cron not sim-driven). Production weekly pipeline **unchanged**. Repo: `expectations_weekly_email.py` + `weekly-email-stage` CLI. Audit [`audits/SC-168-WEEKLY-EMAIL-HANDOFFS-20260905.md`](./audits/SC-168-WEEKLY-EMAIL-HANDOFFS-20260905.md). Optional later allowlisted stage on Ready WAS only.

### SC-169 â€” Missing Achievement Unlocks (Season Sim T122531Z follow-up)

**Priority:** P0  
**Status:** **COMPLETE / Live evidence** (2026-09-05)  
**Systems:** Automations **053 / 054 / 057 / 058 / 059 / 066**, Athlete Achievement Unlocks, Shot Milestones  
**Related:** SC-SEASON-SIM-002  

**False-negative cascade count** â€” expected **4** shot-milestone unlocks for T122531Z; 066â†’059 awarded them (matched SHOT_MILESTONE XP); orphans deleted. Production award logic **unchanged**. Audit [`audits/SC-169-ACHIEVEMENT-UNLOCKS-20260905.md`](./audits/SC-169-ACHIEVEMENT-UNLOCKS-20260905.md). No automation paste.

### SC-171 â€” Daily Submission + Homework Feedback parent presentation

**Priority:** P1  
**Status:** **GitHub ready / PENDING Production paste + Hub deploy** (2026-09-11)  
**Systems:** Automation **076 v8.14**, **071 v4.5**; Communications Hub daily + homework templates (Hub **PR #52** @ `e79637f` merged)  
**Related:** FUT-045 assignment naming; parent email migration; **no XP logic changes**  

**Scope:** Daily Submission â€” remove Extra Credit XP and Shooting Percentage; fix stale streak (076 computes from counted submissions, 055-aligned). Homework Feedback â€” remove Program/slot from display; prominent assignment name; Submitted/Reviewed dates; Homework Files Uploaded; View Athlete Details â†’ `/shoot/athletes/{slug}`.

**Streak root cause:** 076 read `Enrollments.Current Shooting Streak` before 055 finished updating enrollment.

**Evidence:** [`audits/SC-171-EMAIL-HOMEWORK-PRESENTATION-CLOSEOUT-20260906.md`](./audits/SC-171-EMAIL-HOMEWORK-PRESENTATION-CLOSEOUT-20260906.md) Â· checklist [`deploy-checklists/SC-171-email-homework-presentation.md`](./deploy-checklists/SC-171-email-homework-presentation.md) Â· Tier 1 operator runbook [`deploy-checklists/TIER-1-LAUNCH-OPS-RUNBOOK-20260911.md`](./deploy-checklists/TIER-1-LAUNCH-OPS-RUNBOOK-20260911.md) (paste bundles **076 v8.14**, **071 v4.5**).

**Live verify:** Pending â€” post-purge transactional tables empty; disposable Schmidt records + Hub allowlist only.

### SC-172 — Production health + admin diagnostics routes

**Priority:** P0  
**Status:** **Deployed / PENDING `ADMIN_DIAGNOSTICS_TOKEN` + diagnostics smoke** (2026-09-11)  
**Systems:** Next.js `/shoot` web app (`web/app/api/health`, `web/app/admin/diagnostics`, `web/app/api/admin/diagnostics`)  
**Related:** SC-116 admin roadmap; SC-102 / SC-118 smoke; existing `/api/airtable` config probe  

**Problem:** After production redeploy from `master` @ `56e8ebaf`, `/shoot` loaded but `/shoot/api/health`, `/shoot/admin/diagnostics`, and `/shoot/api/admin/diagnostics` returned 404. Inspection found those routes were **never present** on `master` until SC-172 landed.

**Scope:** Add public minimal health probe (`{ "status": "ok" }` only) and fail-closed staff diagnostics (config presence + secret redaction; no athlete data). Auth via `ADMIN_DIAGNOSTICS_TOKEN` (preferred) or `SITE_ACCESS_TOKEN`; athlete sessions denied. Do not change production env values in this item — operators set the admin token separately when ready.

**Acceptance:** Routes exist under `basePath` `/shoot`; health public; diagnostics 401/403 without staff token; no secrets/athlete data in responses; `Cache-Control: no-store`; tests + production build green.

**Evidence:** PR **#505** merged `master` @ `ba3f17dd`; health **200** live (2026-09-10). Remaining: set `ADMIN_DIAGNOSTICS_TOKEN` (Tier 1 Phase B). Prep [`audits/AT-HOME-RELEASE-PREP-2026-09-10.md`](./audits/AT-HOME-RELEASE-PREP-2026-09-10.md) · checklist [`deploy-checklists/SC-172-health-admin-diagnostics.md`](./deploy-checklists/SC-172-health-admin-diagnostics.md) · runbook [`deploy-checklists/TIER-1-LAUNCH-OPS-RUNBOOK-20260911.md`](./deploy-checklists/TIER-1-LAUNCH-OPS-RUNBOOK-20260911.md)
