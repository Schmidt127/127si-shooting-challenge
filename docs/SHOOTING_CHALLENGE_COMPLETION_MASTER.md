# Shooting Challenge Completion Master

## Document purpose

This is the **detailed completion matrix and historical traceability record** for Shooting Challenge V2. It tracks packages, SC items, components, evidence, and remaining work across the full product.

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Purpose** | Completion matrix, package traceability, and preserved historical evidence |
| **Last updated** | **2026-09-12** — living docs synced to tip **`94429042`** (#521); Production **`dpl_6h8wT3nFtuxGveW8DaoN34CWCVyA`**; Hub Homework COMPLETE; season sim **READY — NOT EXECUTED**; see [`CURRENT-TRUTH.md`](./CURRENT-TRUTH.md) + [`audits/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH-RECONCILIATION-20260912.md`](./audits/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH-RECONCILIATION-20260912.md) |
| **Production branch** | `master` |
| **Vercel root** | `web/` |
| **Production website** | https://www.fairfieldbasketballclub.com/shoot |
| **Production Airtable base** | `appn84sqPw03zEbTT` (only active base) |
| **Retired DEV base** | `appTetnuCZlCZdTCT` — retired **2026-08-19**; historical snapshots and read-only install docs only |
| **Created** | 2026-07-23 |

### Authority and evidence boundary

| Role | Document |
|------|----------|
| **Current operational summary** | [`CURRENT-TRUTH.md`](./CURRENT-TRUTH.md) — read this first for live overlays |
| **Detailed ops companion** | [`PROJECT_STATE.md`](./PROJECT_STATE.md) |
| **Automation version inventory** | [`AUTOMATION_VERSION_INVENTORY.md`](./AUTOMATION_VERSION_INVENTORY.md) |
| **Ownership / evidence map** | [`docs/AUTHORITY-MAP.md`](./AUTHORITY-MAP.md) |
| **2026-08-23 inventory** | [`audits/2026-08-23-production-readiness-inventory.md`](./audits/2026-08-23-production-readiness-inventory.md) |
| **Historical production-first experiment** | [`SHOOTING_CHALLENGE_PROD_OPERATING_MODE.md`](./SHOOTING_CHALLENGE_PROD_OPERATING_MODE.md) — context only |

**Evidence boundary:** Repository tests, offline fixtures, and contract suites are **not** production proof. A feature is not complete merely because code exists in GitHub. Live Airtable, Vercel, Make (non-email), Communications Hub, and Resend claims require **dated live evidence** from Mike or named system attestation.

**Historical rows:** Sections dated before 2026-08-23 below are **preserved evidence**. They may describe superseded versions, retired DEV workflows, or pre-reconciliation status. Do not treat them as current production instructions unless this document’s **Current Status Dashboard** or [`CURRENT-TRUTH.md`](./CURRENT-TRUTH.md) explicitly says so.

Older files (`docs/v2-change-backlog.md`, `docs/CHATGPT-MASTER-PLAN-BRIEF.md`, close-out notes, overnight packets, deploy checklists) remain as narrow-purpose documents, evidence, or history. Do not delete them.

## 0Z. Authoritative current-state overlay — 2026-09-08

> **2026-09-12 doc sync:** Git tip **`94429042`** (Production deploy match). Curriculum Hub Homework **COMPLETE / PRODUCTION VERIFIED** (52 structured-enabled; private SEO; Assignment Key Sync). **Required before close:** SC-SEASON-SIM-001 execution + reconciliation only — infrastructure (SC-SEASON-SIM-002) is package-complete, **not** executed. **FUT-043** (#516) + Tier 1 runbook (#517) remain; Mike paste queue **076 v8.14 / 071 v4.5 / 072 v4.9.2 / 073 v4.7 / 074 v3.6 / 117 v2.2** per [`deploy-checklists/TIER-1-LAUNCH-OPS-RUNBOOK-20260911.md`](./deploy-checklists/TIER-1-LAUNCH-OPS-RUNBOOK-20260911.md). SC-172 health live; **`ADMIN_DIAGNOSTICS_TOKEN`** still pending.

> **This overlay supersedes the older “current” dashboards and issue-era statements below wherever they conflict.** Historical dated sections remain preserved evidence and are not being rewritten. For exact live automation versions, use `CURRENT-TRUTH.md`, the Automation Version Inventory, and the named GitHub issues/evidence.

### Controlled Production identity

- Athlete: `recshWT5DQPUZXDvr` — **Testing Schmidt**
- Enrollment: `recn54wbxTjygydqa` — 2026–2027 Shooting Challenge
- Program Instance: `rec5mEM0YPqPqq0hZ` — `Shooting Challenge | 2026-2027`
- Grade Band: `9-12`
- Test emails remain intentionally blank unless a specific allowlisted email test is authorized.
- The prior August Testing Schmidt identities are retired historical fixtures and must not be recreated or reused.

### Season calendar

The final 2027 challenge geometry is verified:

- Early Bird: Apr 25–May 1, 2027
- Week 1: May 2–May 8
- Week 2: May 9–May 15
- Week 3: May 16–May 22
- Week 4: May 23–May 29
- Week 5: May 30–Jun 5
- Week 6: Jun 6–Jun 12
- Week 7: Jun 13–Jun 19
- Week 8: Jun 20–Jun 26
- Week 9: Jun 27–Jun 30 (intentional partial terminal Week)
- Post-Challenge: Jul 1–Jul 3

Live Airtable readback confirmed Week 9 and Post-Challenge boundaries. Repository repair PR #495 is merged; Production paste/live proof for **057 v2.6 / 118 v2.1 / 119 v1.8** remains pending under #121.

### Homework and Structured Curriculum

- Homework scheduling is **PHA-first and just-in-time**. There is no fixed 90-row season seed.
- Automation 067’s PHA-first defect is resolved; issue #120 is closed Completed.
- Public Homework catalog/detail is **PHA-first and Production-runtime verified**; issue #125 is closed Completed. Live Fairfield proof confirms 19 active PHA rows resolve to 18 schedulable assignments with one deterministic Week 1 / HW1 duplicate, unassigned published curriculum fails closed, and assigned detail pages use the PHA Week/slot.
- Structured Curriculum file assets PR **#486** is merged (`04448e13c423306ca0d4afcf28f2a1cd394da65d`). Remaining cutover: paste **070a/070b v4.8**, remove only 070a trigger condition `Submission - Linked isNotEmpty`, then run the signed Shot Tracker file-upload E2E proving HC + Submission Asset + canonical URL and **0 Daily Submissions**.

### XP integrity and progression

- Issue #100 orphan XP cleanup/reconciliation is **closed Completed**. The authorized live cleanup reduced the exact `Active? = true AND Enrollment blank` population **52 → 0**; recurrence detection and bounded reconciliation controls are merged.
- Automation **042 remains the sole progression-output writer**. Automation 043 remains retired / do-not-recreate.
- Issues #98 and #118 are closed Completed; current 041/042 reconciliation architecture supersedes their older issue-era assumptions.
- Weekly Threshold / Perfect Week eligibility-loss issue #102 has repository reconciliation merged; controlled Production threshold withdrawal/regain/replay proof remains pending.
- Video XP source-safety issue #101 has repository repair merged (**113 v6.5 / 114 v6.3**); native Airtable paste and controlled lifecycle proof remain pending.

### Public website / SEO

- Public search indexing is **approved and deployed**; issue #56 is closed Completed.
- Public athlete profiles are intended to be indexable with Fairfield Basketball Club canonicals; stale `noindex` / “SEO deferred” rows below are historical and must not be used as current instructions.
- Protected/admin/API surfaces remain excluded from indexing.

### Email / Communications Hub

- Communications Hub → Resend remains the current Shooting Challenge email plane; Make/Gmail email paths are historical/retired where superseded.
- #104/#105 repository/source defects are superseded by later repairs; both remain open only for controlled disposable delivery/replay proof.
- Welcome contract #126 is repository-complete through **078A v1.7**, using deterministic key `WELCOME|SHOOTING_CHALLENGE|<Enrollment RID>`; native Airtable paste + one-send/replay proof remain pending.

### Current desktop Production cutover queue

1. Structured Curriculum: **070a v4.8 + trigger edit; 070b v4.8; signed Shot Tracker E2E**.
2. Season boundary: **057 v2.6 / 118 v2.1 / 119 v1.8** + boundary proof (#121).
3. Video XP safety: **113 v6.5 / 114 v6.3** + controlled lifecycle proof (#101).
4. Welcome: **078A v1.7** + one-send/replay proof (#126).
5. Weekly Threshold reconciliation: controlled dry-run/withdraw/regain/replay proof (#102).
6. Parent email: disposable HOMEWORK/VIDEO/DAILY/WEEKLY delivery/replay proofs (#104/#105).

### Issue reconciliation already completed on 2026-09-08

Closed Completed: **#56, #98, #100, #103, #118, #120, #125**.  
Merged repository repairs include **#486, #489–#495, #497**.  
Still live-proof dependent: **#101, #102, #104, #105, #121, #126**.

### Historical operator overlays (superseded — preserved evidence)

> **Historical entry retained.** The block below records 2026-08-16 path evidence and 2026-08-19 overlays. Superseded by §0–§0D and [`CURRENT-TRUTH.md`](./CURRENT-TRUTH.md) on **2026-08-23**. Do not use version strings here as current paste instructions.

The 2026-08-16 controlled-path evidence is in [`prod-completion/2026-08-16/SC-2026-08-16-CURRENT-STATE-RECONCILIATION.md`](./prod-completion/2026-08-16/SC-2026-08-16-CURRENT-STATE-RECONCILIATION.md). **022 v2.1**, **020 v3.7** (not v3.6), **070b v4.7** (not v4.6), **066 v3.8**, **010 v10.12** (not v10.10), **117 v2.1** Hub handoff remain current per §0A.

## 1. Operating Rules

These rules apply to this reconciliation and future release-status maintenance.

1. **GitHub is the source of truth for committed code, scripts, and documentation.**
2. **Airtable, Fillout, Make, Gmail, Lambda, and Vercel live state belongs to those systems.** Repository text must not be used to claim current live configuration.
3. **production-only and Mike approval rules remain in force.** This reconciliation makes no live-system changes.
4. **Historical evidence is preserved.** Do not delete historical documents, records, or useful test evidence as a documentation cleanup.
5. **Controlled tests, natural triggers, offline tests, and full end-to-end proof are distinct evidence classes.**
6. **Automation 115 is intentionally request-based, not idempotent:** every explicit checked Run Test request creates one new production-shaped Submission; downstream dedupe is a separate contract.
7. **A successful 115 creation does not prove 005, 009, 020, 064, XP, weekly summary, Make, or email behavior.**
8. **System dependency safety remains mandatory.** Protect structure and connected workflows:
   - table links, formulas, lookups, rollups, counts
   - automation scripts and triggers
   - Make scenarios
   - Fillout field mappings
   - Lambda / storage workflows
   - website Airtable queries
   - field names and single-select options used by scripts
   - duplicate-prevention keys (Source Keys / XP Dedupe Keys)
   - one writer per field (do not create competing automations)
9. **Schmidt testing enrollment** is the primary controlled live test athlete when Mike runs an authorized check.
10. **Code in GitHub is not the same as “working in PROD.”** A feature is only Complete when repository work, installation, and live testing are all satisfied where they apply.
11. **Airtable automation-count constraint:** Use consolidated automations where practical. Repository-only modular alternatives must not be represented as active PROD automations. The active canonical automation directory and deployment inventory must distinguish deployed scripts from archived/design alternatives.

---

## 1A. Zoom workflow ownership (PROD)

| Function | Active owner | Airtable automation slot used? |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Zoom attendance normalization (recording quiz) | No deployed Airtable automation (design alternatives only) | No |
| Zoom attendance credit / `ZOOM_CREDIT` XP | No deployed Airtable automation | No |
| Live Zoom meeting XP | Automation **101** | Yes |
| Gate Applied? | Automation **042** | Yes |
| Perfect Week Applied? | Automation **057** | Yes |
| Recording approval email handoff | Automation **117** (**v2.1** Hub queue create — Mike 2026-08-19) | Yes — creates Email Handoff Queue; **079** → Hub → Resend |
| Make/Gmail Zoom approval send | Make workflow **117f** | **Historical only** — not current send plane |

Canonical file for Automation 117: `airtable/automations/shooting-challenge/117-zoom-send-recording-approval-email-to-make.js` (filename still says Make; live paste is Hub handoff **v2.1**).
Runbook history: `docs/deploy-checklists/117-zoom-recording-approval-email.md` (older Make path — treat as historical where it conflicts).
**Do not** paste the Stage 17 orchestrator into PROD Automation 117. **Do not** create 117a/117b/117c Airtable slots.

## 2. Status Definitions

**Reconciled labels (2026-08-23):** Use these in §0C and new reconciliation work:

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `complete` | Repository + install + live proof all satisfied where applicable |
| `repository-ready` | Code/docs/tests merged; live proof not claimed |
| `live-tested` | Controlled or natural live Production proof on record |
| `needs live proof` | Repository work exists; live evidence missing |
| `Mike decision` | Product, schema, or external-service authorization required |
| `blocked` | Dependency or lock prevents safe work |
| `deferred` | Intentionally postponed |
| `historical only` | Preserved evidence; not current instruction |
| `retired` | Deliberately off, deleted, or superseded |

**Legacy labels** below remain on older SC rows and dashboards. When updating rows, map to the reconciled labels above.

| Status | Plain-language meaning |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Brainstormed** | Idea exists; no firm plan yet. |
| **Decision Needed** | Mike must choose before more build work. |
| **Planned** | Direction is clear enough to implement; not built yet. |
| **Built in Repository** | Code/docs/scripts exist in GitHub; not confirmed installed in PROD. |
| **Installed in PROD** | Present in the live PROD base / Make / Lambda / web deploy, but not fully live-tested after the empty-base reset (or never live-tested). |
| **Live Tested in PROD** | Installed and proven with controlled live PROD records (Schmidt or equivalent). Still missing final close-out if any. |
| **Complete** | Repository work + PROD install + live PROD test all done (where applicable), or the item is fully finished documentation/decision work that needs no further live proof. |
| **Deferred** | Intentionally postponed. |
| **Superseded** | Replaced by a newer SC item or design. |
| **Not Needed** | No longer required under current operating rules or product decisions. |

**Honesty rule:** Prior 2025–26 “live pass” evidence used athlete data that no longer exists. After the empty-base reset, athlete-path features that were once proven are treated as **Installed in PROD** (or lower) until re-proven on Schmidt test data — unless the item was pure documentation, a one-off historical repair, or a permanent external system (for example Lambda code) that does not depend on wiped rows.

---

## 2A. Current release-control truth — 2026-08-10

> **Partially superseded.** Core proven/not-proven boundaries remain valid. For current component and automation status, prefer **§0–§0D** (reconciled 2026-08-23). This section preserves the 2026-08-10 evidence ledger.

This section is the current release-status overlay. Dated sections below are
historical evidence ledgers and technical records; they do not supersede this
overlay.

### Proven

- PR [#137](https://github.com/Schmidt127/127-si-shooting-challenge/pull/137),
  [#138](https://github.com/Schmidt127/127-si-shooting-challenge/pull/138),
  and [#139](https://github.com/Schmidt127/127-si-shooting-challenge/pull/139)
  are merged to `master`.
- Automation 067 v3.4 controlled PROD first pass and replay passed.
- Automation 115 v2.1 controlled PROD proof passed twice. Each explicit checked
  request intentionally created one distinct Submission.
- Testing Scenarios.Homework Assignment links **Program Homework Assignments**.
- Mike supplied Production evidence that Homework XP 020 v3.5, 064 v12.2,
  and 065 v10.1 were installed with 064/065 ON and 071 OFF; 063/068 were
  absent/retired. Completion `rec3FDdZXlXjhcTj4` created, withdrew, and
  restored the same canonical event `recJGcfipFyKwiSC5` with Source Key
  `HOMEWORK_XP|rec3FDdZXlXjhcTj4`. Cursor did not independently access
  Airtable.
- The `/shoot` web release includes PR #138 imagery and retains the approved
  pre-launch `noindex, nofollow` policy. Deployment state must still be verified
  in Vercel.

### Not proven by this package

- 067/115 creation does not prove 005/009/020/064, Homework XP, summaries,
  Make/S3, email, or full season behavior.
- Controlled automation-action tests do not prove natural-trigger behavior.
- Offline tests do not prove controlled PROD behavior.
- The supplied Homework evidence proves creation, automatic withdrawal, and
  same-event restoration for that controlled lifecycle only; it does not prove
  every Homework path, progression rollup, standings path, or full-season
  behavior.
- Daily-submission XP reversal is a separate P0 concern. Repository evidence
  shows positive-only correction reachability gaps for Submission Base XP,
  streak XP, and shot-milestone XP; no Production correction claim is made.
- Repository text does not prove current Airtable, Fillout, Make, Gmail, or
  Vercel configuration.

### Open / blocked / deferred

- Fresh Schmidt athlete-path proof after the current base reset remains open.
- 2027 Weeks/config validation, Fillout activation, season-sensitive
  automation review, Make/email safety, and final Mike launch approval remain
  open.
- The current today-based Early Bird record is a temporary testing fixture and
  must be shortened or replaced before the 2027 launch.
- No fixed week count is authoritative; Airtable Weeks is manually maintained.

### 2027 season authority

Challenge window is May 1–June 30, 2027; Early Bird is April 25–May 1, 2027;
Week 1 starts May 2, 2027. Every new season begins at Level 1 with 0 season XP.
Fillout manually controls enrollment availability. See the
[authority map](./AUTHORITY-MAP.md) for ownership and evidence boundaries.

### Rolling next actions

| Owner | Next action |
|---|---|
| Mike | Verify live Weeks/config, temporary Early Bird fixture, Fillout availability, and launch approval in the named live systems |
| Cursor Desktop | Maintain the Completion Master, CONTROL, authority map, and deterministic stale-reference audit |
| Cursor Online | Review the focused reconciliation PR and its evidence boundaries |
| Airtable | Supply a read-only current export or UI attestation for live configuration and controlled test results |
| Codex | No action until a named, approved repository task is assigned |

## 2B. Active Execution Matrix — 2026-08-10

This is the execution queue for approved work that is still incomplete,
blocked, awaiting live proof, awaiting a Mike decision, or explicitly deferred.
It is a traceability index, not a second status authority or a production
activation plan. Complete items are intentionally omitted from the active queue;
their historical evidence remains below.

**State vocabulary:** `ready` means a bounded repository package can start;
`needs repo work` means implementation or documentation is incomplete;
`needs live proof` means repository work exists but live-system evidence is
missing; `Mike decision` means product, activation, schema, or external-service
authorization is required; `blocked` means a dependency prevents safe work;
`deferred` means intentionally postponed.

**Package traceability rule:** Every implementation PR must state
`Execution matrix IDs advanced: <PKG-* IDs>` in its description (reviewer
convention; the local audit cannot inspect GitHub PR descriptions). The PR must
also update the corresponding row's state and **Current evidence / updated**
field with a dated entry beginning `Execution matrix IDs advanced: PKG-###`.
A repository or offline test cannot promote an item to controlled PROD proof,
natural-trigger proof, or activation.

Current traceability entry dated 2026-08-10:

Matrix initialized 2026-08-10 — no implementation package has started; all
rows remain at their queued baseline.

Execution matrix IDs advanced: PKG-025 — repository-only Levels orientation
added; no live deployment, smoke proof, or activation claim.

Execution matrix IDs advanced: PKG-025 — repository-only Public Display
refresh control added; no live deployment, smoke proof, or activation claim.

Execution matrix IDs advanced: PKG-021 — repository-only Game Manual
quick-start orientation added; no approved 2027 rules, live proof, or
activation claim.

Execution matrix IDs advanced: PKG-002 — repository-only configuration
inventory and Production-safe local configuration boundary; no live-system proof.

Execution matrix IDs advanced: PKG-037 — repository-only core-certification
packet, offline mixed-XP contract, and stale operator-instruction corrections;
no live-system proof, activation, or Production data claim.

Execution matrix IDs advanced: PKG-007 — repository-only Video Feedback 073 v4.3
writeback contract test alignment (`tests/video-feedback/video-feedback-writeback-complete-contract.test.js`);
stale v4.2 version-header expectation updated to production-aligned v4.3 branded-payload
regression; no automation script, Airtable data, email send, or Video XP logic changes.

Execution matrix IDs advanced: PKG-041 — MRW-F08 offline contract suite (2026-08-30):
reconciled `docs-canonical-header` drift in `docs/automation-index.md` and
`airtable/schema/current/automation-trigger-map.md` (057 v2.2, 058 v1.5, 041 v5.1,
042 v4.1.2, 076 v8.11, 101 v6.6, 118 v2.0); expanded `run-agent4-suite.js` with
remaining `tests/automation-contracts/` coverage. No automation logic changes.

### Recommended sequence

1. **Next package — `PKG-001` (P0): Automation 005 / SC-076 failure
   investigation.** Reproduce the unresolved failure classes with current
   source contracts and offline fixtures, document the root cause and exact
   live proof still needed, and add only deterministic tests or evidence
   boundaries. This is the highest-value unresolved item that can advance in
   the repository without Airtable, Fillout, Make, Vercel, or production
   changes.
2. **Following package — `PKG-002` (P1): Config-over-code and automation
   hardcode inventory.** Complete the bounded V2-002 / SC-034 inventory and
   contract checks after `PKG-001`; do not rewrite automations or change
   configuration in that package.

Neither package is started by this traceability PR. `PKG-005` (Learning
Activities schema) and `PKG-009` (2027 Weeks/activation) remain later because
they require Mike-owned schema or live-system decisions.

| ID | Exact feature / fix / improvement | State | Source section / link | Dependency | Owner | Evidence required for completion | Current evidence / updated | Systems involved | Recommended next action | Order |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|
| `PKG-001` | Investigate unresolved Automation 005 failure behavior and the remaining SC-076 first-create versus replay boundary | `needs live proof` | §4 SC-005, SC-076; §5 Testing / XP | Current 005/066 source and fixtures; no live write | Cursor | Reproducible offline result, source-level root cause, explicit controlled-proof card, and separate natural-trigger requirement | 2026-08-10 — Execution matrix IDs advanced: PKG-001 — diagnosis report `docs/agent-runs/results/PKG-001-AUTOMATION-005-SC-076-DIAGNOSIS.md`; no safe code fix; deployed intake mapping and controlled live readback remain unverified | Repo; Airtable; Mike | Mike supplies deployed 005/023 versions, trigger/action trace, and controlled record values before a repair package | 1 |

### PKG-034 Production installation closeout — 2026-08-13

Mike supplied the authoritative evidence for Production base
`127SI - SHOOTING CHALLENGE GAME - NEW 5_1_2026`
(`appn84sqPw03zEbTT`). Automation 101 v6.1 is installed and ON with a
`When record matches conditions` trigger on `Zoom Meetings`, sole condition
`Zoom XP Reconciliation Needed? = 1`, and dynamic `recordId`. No
`Create XP Events`, `Attendees`, or `Completed` trigger condition is present.
The nine field IDs are recorded in
[`pkg-034-zoom-reconciliation-fields.md`](pkg-034-zoom-reconciliation-fields.md).

After Mike manually deleted unused 2025–2026 meetings
`rec3ToANr5pcs2SRG` and `reczeUT0AJUWMmEOb`, the final read-only
`audit-zoom-live-attendance-xp-lifecycle` v1.0 checked 2 meetings and 16 XP
Events: 0 Zoom XP Events, 0 unsupported recording XP Events, and 0
duplicate/reward-rule/ownership/backlink/lifecycle errors. The 2
`missing_enrollment_links` warnings correspond to the two intentionally empty
future rosters. Introduction `recMFP2x5LDqea9ax` and Motivation
`recb9EjQIJVzaRpZa` both reached Needed = 0 with
`reconciled_empty_roster_no_award` and no XP Event.

This is installation and empty-roster Production proof only. Live-attendee
Base XP creation, replay/deduplication, Bonus 2, Bonus 3, fourth-meeting
preservation, withdrawal, same-event restoration, inactive Enrollment
correction, WAS/lifetime XP, 041→042 progression, standings, and recording XP
remain pending. Cursor did not access or modify Production.

The immediate-initial-assignment child scope of `PKG-014` is complete in
Production; the broader level-progression, blocked-gate-clear, replay, and
Zoom-credit proof remains open. The bounded trigger/version attestation for
`PKG-016` is recorded below; the full live automation inventory remains open.

The matrix preserves the final 2027 rules: challenge season **May 1–June 30,
2027**; normal Early Bird **April 25–May 1, 2027**; Week 1 begins **May 2,
2027**; Airtable Weeks is manually maintained and authoritative; there is no
fixed season-week count; every new season starts at Level 1 with 0 season XP;
Fillout availability is manually controlled; and the current today-based Early
Bird record is temporary testing only.

### Current PROD reconciliation (2026-08-12)

This is the closeout evidence for the immediate initial-level assignment
promotion. Production validation was skipped under Mike’s explicit Production
authorization; no Production proof is claimed. The next scheduled 041 idempotency
observation was not supplied and remains pending.

| Item | Current status | Current truth |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| Automation **001 v5.4** | **Installed in PROD / controlled registration PASS** | Existing registration trigger and dynamic Enrollment `recordId` preserved. Controlled `RADON Schmidt` registration created Enrollment `recqOR0A3RGjFjI3u` (`Schmidt, RADON - 2026-2027`) in Production base `appn84sqPw03zEbTT`; Active, School Year `2026-2027`, Program Instance `Shooting Challenge \| 2026-2027`, Grade Band `5-6`. Welcome email received once; no manual recalculation intervention. |
| Automation **041 v4.0** | **Installed in PROD / scheduled reconciliation retained** | Scheduled trigger ON; optional `recordId` blank. Earlier scheduled scan reported `success`, `queued`, `scannedCount = 7`, `queuedCount = 7`. Post-registration idempotency observation remains pending. |
| Automation **042 v3.4** | **Installed in PROD / immediate initial assignment PASS** | Existing “when record enters view” trigger, selected view, and dynamic triggering-record `recordId` preserved. The controlled Enrollment reached Lifetime XP `0`, Current Level `Beginner`, Next Level `Rookie Shooter`, Level Gate Rule `Level 2 Gate`, Level Status `Assigned`; 001 checked the request and 042 cleared it before the next scheduled 041 scan. |
| Production view **042 - Needs Level Assignment** | **Configured** | Filters are `Level Recalc Needed?` checked and `Active?` checked. The existing inactive blocked duplicate is absent from the view; it was not manually processed and no new duplicate was created. |
| Level configuration | **Verified** | Exactly one active cumulative zero-XP Level exists (`Beginner`); `Rookie Shooter` requires `200 XP`; an active `2026-2027` Level 2 Gate exists. |
| Automation **043** | **Retired / not deployed** | No recreation or replacement was performed; 042 remains the progression-output writer. |

Exact registration, Automation 001, and Automation 042 run timestamps were
not supplied in the Production evidence and remain unrecorded.

### Current PROD reconciliation (2026-08-08)

This is a dated evidence record for the affected automations. Older dashboard
reconciliations below remain historical evidence and must not be read as
current paste-pending status. Live installation and controlled Schmidt proof
must be verified in Airtable; repository text records the evidence boundary only.

| Item | Current status | Current truth |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| Automation **010 v10.6** | **Installed in PROD / live replay PASS** | Controlled replay of `recElDBcFvuE6jWwc` reused/updated existing XP Event `recHHhpkgQS1hhIHo`; candidate count `1`, no duplicate, operator restored 010 ON. This proves idempotent replay/update behavior, not separate first-create proof. |
| Automation **031 v3.5** | **Installed in PROD / canonical resolution PASS** | Empty-link controlled run resolved the canonical summary, rejected a malformed zero-Week candidate, created no duplicate summary, and caused no XP churn; operator restored 031 ON. Already-linked stale-summary repair remains offline-tested only. |
| Automation **053 v5.3** | **Existing verified PROD status retained** | Prior operator-confirmed current status remains controlling for this reconciliation. |
| Automation **066 v3.5** | **Live Tested in PROD (existing-unlock replay)** | Controlled enrollment replay found 8 eligible milestones, skipped all 8 existing unlocks, created no duplicates, and did not reproduce the prior `records[0].fields` error. |
| Automation **042 v3.3** | **Complete / Live Tested in PROD** | Installed in PROD and run twice on controlled Schmidt Enrollment `recCyFEPeATOVNlr9` (`School Year = 2026-2027`). First run PASS and controlled replay PASS: Lifetime XP `688`; Current Level `Rookie Shooter`; Next Level `Developing Shooter`; selected `Level 3 Gate` `recrLcVfwPcWGflR2` from the `2026-2027` rule set; `Gate Blocked` because `Submissions 13/15`; `Level Recalc Needed?` cleared. Replay produced the identical result with no unexpected link/status churn. 042 remains the sole progression-output writer; 043 is not deployed and must not be recreated. GitHub issue **#97 complete**. |
| Automation **118 v1.7** | **Installed/active in PROD; no-target fail-safe PASS** | Production inputs were restored and the schedule is ON. `skipped_no_target_week` produced zero writes and zero armed builds; the positive `build_armed` branch awaits a real eligible completed Week. |
| Automation **119 v1.7** | **Installed/active in PROD; no-target fail-safe PASS** | Production inputs were restored and the schedule is ON. `skipped_no_target_week` produced zero writes and zero armed sends; the positive send-arm branch awaits a real eligible completed Week/package. |
| Automation **043** | **Not deployed / not required** | No native Airtable automation was found. The stale governance row is not deployment proof. Do not recreate 043; 042 remains the sole progression-output writer. Issue #95 is superseded/not planned; Issue #97 is complete; Issue #98 remains open. |

Evidence: [`AUTOMATION-042-V3.3-SCHOOL-YEAR-LIVE-PROOF.md`](./prod-completion/2026-08-08/AUTOMATION-042-V3.3-SCHOOL-YEAR-LIVE-PROOF.md), [`docs/prod-completion/2026-08-08/PROD-STATE-RECONCILIATION-010-031-066-118-119-043.md`](./prod-completion/2026-08-08/PROD-STATE-RECONCILIATION-010-031-066-118-119-043.md), [`AUTOMATION-010-V10.6-LIVE-REPLAY-PROOF.md`](./prod-completion/2026-08-08/AUTOMATION-010-V10.6-LIVE-REPLAY-PROOF.md), [`AUTOMATION-031-V3.5-CANONICAL-RESOLUTION-LIVE-PROOF.md`](./prod-completion/2026-08-08/AUTOMATION-031-V3.5-CANONICAL-RESOLUTION-LIVE-PROOF.md), [`AUTOMATION-066-V3.5-LIVE-PROOF.md`](./prod-completion/2026-08-08/AUTOMATION-066-V3.5-LIVE-PROOF.md).

**Issue boundaries:** #97 is complete; #98 remains unresolved/open. Do not reintroduce the stale orphan-XP bulk count from #100; remaining #100 scope is recurrence prevention only.

## 2A. Current app/base closeout overlay — 2026-08-10

The dated packet [`SCV2-APP-BASE-CLOSEOUT-001.md`](./prod-completion/2026-08-10/SCV2-APP-BASE-CLOSEOUT-001.md) is the current evidence overlay for the PHA-first homework closeout. It preserves historical evidence and does not reopen Package 10.

| Item | Current status | Current evidence / next proof |
|---|---|---|
| 005 → 009 → 020 | **Installed in PROD / path proven** | Initial `rectWmGA1K2RSN4bp` and replay `recPPrwds0oz0EB4C` reused Homework Completion `recyU1G9mWC1rQSst`; no duplicate created |
| 067 v3.4 | **Live Tested in PROD** | Quiz `recAO1S9TdZHupl7t` created/reused Homework Completion `reckpeVV9G3M13j5U`; controlled proof passed, including idempotency. This proves the 067 bridge and duplicate guard, not Homework XP or full downstream completion. |
| 115 v2.1 | **Live Tested in PROD** | Scenario `recXjRRg8n0NodziZ` produced Submissions `rec7e5X7QaVDZLpiL` and `recbbO685zSEuyzM9` from two explicit checked `Run Test?` requests. Each request intentionally creates a new production-shaped Submission; 115 is not an idempotent Submission processor. |
| Homework Library | **Proven for the 067/115 controlled paths** | Current controlled proof used the PHA-linked Homework Library identity; no unsupported historical record identity is asserted here |
| Program Homework Assignment | **PHA-first identity proven for the 067/115 controlled paths** | Testing Scenarios Homework Assignment links Program Homework Assignments; 115 carries the PHA RID and 005/020 preserve the PHA + Library distinction |
| Package 10 | **Closed / preserved** | PR #133 merged/deployed; PR #134 corrected 115's stale header; no reopen |

### Closeout items still requiring Mike evidence

Fresh Schmidt athlete-path proof after the reset and season-launch readiness remain open. Testing Views (10/10, zero sanity failures), Automation 057 controlled PROD proof, Automation 035 v1.2 creation/idempotency proof, and the current 067/115 controlled PROD outcomes are preserved evidence. Automation 035 remains OFF pending approval. The 067/115 proofs do not claim Homework XP, Make/S3, email, or full end-to-end season behavior.

No status in this overlay is marked Complete or Live Tested solely from a governance-table row, stale install packet, or script header. The full test cards, expected links, duplicate checks, returned record IDs, and console-output requirements are in the dated packet.

### Historical dashboard reconciliation (2026-08-06 — Program Instance isolation package)

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Architecture rule | Documented | Athlete → Enrollment → Program Instance scopes all challenge progress |
| Automation **005 v4.1** | **Live Tested in PROD** | Activity Date Fallback → Early Bird `recWeVrSabnsYaHc2`; 12 same-PI / 13 other-PI excluded on `recElDBcFvuE6jWwc` |
| Automation **023 v3.1** | **Installed in PROD** / **Live Tested PASS** | Primary controlled run on `recElDBcFvuE6jWwc` assigned `recCyFEPeATOVNlr9` with `programInstanceSource=submission-week`; replay returned `existing-valid-enrollment` with `wroteUpdate=false`. |

### Dashboard reconciliation (2026-08-12 — Automation 076 v8.5 single-select write hotfix)

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Automation **031 v4.0 / 076 v8.5** | **Built in Repository; Production replacement pending** | 031 remains the approved authoritative normal-athlete-activity WAS creator. 076 v8.5 retains the v8.4 cleaned-recipient correction and writes queue `Event Type` and `Status` single-selects using Airtable-compatible `{ name: ... }` objects. The verified `Program Instance - Sync` table, queue behavior, readiness guards, dynamic `recordId`, and deterministic replay remain intact. `rec58gdymfPKKeVRI` is temporary manual-test-only. Paste order is 076 v8.5 first, then 031 v4.0. [`AUTOMATION-031-PASTE-AND-TEST-PACKET.md`](./prod-completion/2026-08-07/AUTOMATION-031-PASTE-AND-TEST-PACKET.md) · [`PKG-006-DAILY-SUBMISSION-HUB-HANDOFF.md`](./deploy-checklists/PKG-006-DAILY-SUBMISSION-HUB-HANDOFF.md) |
| Focused validation | **PASS — 031 28/28; 076 v8.5 focused suite; 010 9/9** | 031 tests: **28/28 passed**; 076 focused tests cover cleaned-parent success, raw-parent rejection, recipient deduplication, invalid/missing parent fail-closed behavior, Airtable-compatible single-select writes, and deterministic replay; 010 tests: **9/9 passed**; 076 canonical contracts passed; syntax passed; `git diff --check` passed; IDE diagnostics reported no errors. Repository ESLint remains unavailable because no `eslint.config.*` exists; broad lint is not claimed. |

Production installation, live testing, and email delivery remain Mike-owned and are not claimed by this repository change.

### Dashboard reconciliation (2026-08-07 — Automation 031 stale-link repo repair)

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Automation **031 v3.5** | **Historical: Built in Repository; now Installed in PROD / canonical resolution PASS** | Issue **#96** repair validates existing/candidate summaries against Enrollment + Week + Program Instance + Summary Key; 2026-08-08 live proof confirms malformed-candidate rejection and canonical empty-link resolution. Already-linked stale-summary repair remains offline-tested only. |
| Offline regression | **PASS** | `node --test tools/testing/tests/test_031_offline.mjs` (13/13) |

| SC-027 / SC-076 | Unchanged bucket | Unlock/XP Live Tested via backfill→059 only; natural 066 not advanced by PR merge |

**Net math:** no Section 4 Complete/LT/Installed bucket moves from PR #88 alone. 033 Installed attestation is operator paste (was Built paste-pending).

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Automation **010 v10.6** | **Historical: Built in Repository; now Installed in PROD / replay PASS** | 2026-08-08 controlled replay reused/updated the existing XP Event with one candidate and no duplicate; first-create proof remains separate |

### Dashboard reconciliation (2026-08-06 — Automation 066 v3.4 createRecords fields fix)

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Automation **066** natural path | **Historical failure — superseded by v3.5 live proof** | v3.3 previously failed on raw `createRecordsAsync` payloads; the 2026-08-08 v3.5 controlled replay passed on `recCyFEPeATOVNlr9`. |
| Repo fix | **Installed and Live Tested in PROD — v3.5** | Existing-unlock replay detected 8 eligible milestones, skipped all 8, created 0 duplicates, and reproduced no `records[0] should have a 'fields' property` error. |
| SC-027 / SC-076 current claim | **Live Tested in PROD for existing-unlock replay** | This proves the controlled replay/idempotency path; retain the separate distinction between backfill-created awards and natural first-create behavior. |
| PROD paste | **Complete for this proof** | No further 066 paste/replay is required unless source, trigger, schema, or milestone data changes. |

**Do not award duplicate milestone XP during retest** — existing `SHOT_MILESTONE\|recCyFEPeATOVNlr9\|*` unlocks/XP must be linked/skipped, not recreated.

### Dashboard reconciliation (2026-08-05 — Overnight Agent 2 foundation)

| SC | Old status | New status | Evidence |
|----|------------|------------|----------|
| SC-023 | Installed in PROD | **Live Tested in PROD** | Cleared Grade Band on `recCyFEPeATOVNlr9`; Automation **002** reassigned **3-4** (`reclWDQZzKbVBtdhG`) within ~6s. **003 v2.0** grade-change refresh **COMPLETE / PRODUCTION-VERIFIED** 2026-09-03 (disposable VERIFY Enrollment; keep active) |
| SC-027 | **Live Tested in PROD** | 066 v3.5 controlled replay on `recCyFEPeATOVNlr9`: 8 eligible milestones, 8 existing unlocks skipped, 0 duplicates; prior v3.3 failure is historical |
| SC-029 | Installed in PROD | **Live Tested in PROD** | Schmidt streak ladder XP present (3 Source Keys); Current Streak **8** |
| SC-048 | Planned | **Live Tested in PROD** | PROD formula `XP Date Resolved` SWITCH case fixed `Submission Base`→`Shooting Base` (Meta API); `isValid=true` |
| SC-060 | Built in Repository | **Live Tested in PROD** | Align with existing 001 v5.2 PROD paste + live proof (`recCyFEPeATOVNlr9`) |
| SC-061 | Built in Repository | **Live Tested in PROD** | Same — matched-existing athlete, no duplicate |
| SC-075 | Installed in PROD | **Live Tested in PROD** | Streak XP Events on enrollment; Current Streak 8 / Longest 7 |
| SC-076 | **Live Tested in PROD** | Existing-unlock replay through 066 v3.5 passed with 8 skips and 0 new unlocks; prior 059/backfill proof remains historical context |
| SC-079 | Installed in PROD | **Live Tested in PROD** | Level Status **Gate Blocked**; Gate Debug `Sub 9/10 \| Vid 5/6` |

**Net math vs concurrent Agent 1/3/4 dashboard (LT 25 / Installed 46 / Built 24 / Planned 17):** LT →**34**; Installed →**40**; Built →**22**; Planned →**16**. Complete unchanged.

**Historical blocker (superseded 2026-08-08):** Automation **066** v3.3 previously failed live with `createRecordsAsync` missing `fields`. Automation 066 v3.5 now has a controlled PROD replay/idempotency PASS; do not carry the old v3.3/v3.4 paste-required state forward as current truth.

**Net math vs Agent 3 closeout (intermediate, before Agent 2):** LT 24→**25**; Installed 47→**46**. Final dashboard after Agent 2: LT **34** / Installed **40** / Built **22** / Planned **16**.

| SC-058 | Built in Repository | **Historical drift-auditor snapshot** | Operator-table audit 48 rows; the 117/118/119 absence is superseded by the 2026-08-08 direct editor/schedule proof; 112 still requires UI attestation |
| SC-147 | Built in Repository | **Built in Repository** (PROD export+CLI) | Sanitized export + RCC CLI exit 0; views not installed — [`RCC-OMNI-VIEW-INSTALL.md`](./deploy-checklists/RCC-OMNI-VIEW-INSTALL.md) |

| SC-139 | Built in Repository | **Built in Repository** (partial) | automation-index 117/117c wording corrected |

**Net math:** no bucket moves. Packages reduce Mike setup friction; live 073/117f still need Mike-authorized fixtures. **WELCOME send** is Communications Hub (079), not Make — see §9M.

**Do not claim:** live Gmail sends, Make webhook posts, RCC views installed, SC-088 Complete.

**Note:** This closes the HC WAS Link clarification + CASE-01 eligibility proof package. Broader Perfect Week SC items (unlock 058 / XP 059 / multi-case fixtures) remain open per SC-021/028/077 — do not mark those Complete from CASE-01 alone.

**Net math vs post–SC-009/SC-101 closeout:** Complete 15→**17**; LT 23→**22** (SC-003 −1); Installed 49→**48** (SC-017 −1); Built stays **24**.

**Historical next-package note (superseded):** earlier closeout said paste **057 v1.4** — PROD is now **v1.5**; use live-verification runbook instead.

### Dashboard reconciliation (2026-08-05 — Automation 071 Reviewer File URL)

| SC | Old status | New status | Source of change | Evidence |
|----|------------|------------|------------------|----------|
| SC-017 | Installed in PROD | **Installed in PROD** (repo advanced; later closed) | Automation **071 v3.5** uses `Reviewer File URL` → Drive View → Drive File | `071-…js` v3.5; offline tests; superseded by live closeout above |
| SC-045 | Installed in PROD | **Installed in PROD** | Homework parent email contract unblocked for AWS/Lambda assets | Same |

**Historical note:** At merge of PR #77 the package was pending PROD paste. Operator attestation 2026-08-05 closed the live gate (see reconciliation above).

**Parent email asset URL priority:** `Reviewer File URL` → `Google Drive View URL` → `Google Drive File URL`. Filenames are labels only. Make owns Sent? after Gmail success.

### Dashboard reconciliation (2026-08-05 — SC-009 / SC-101 final PROD closeout)

**Net math vs post–SC-003 aliases:** Complete 13→**15**; LT 23 stays **23** (SC-009 −1, SC-095 +1); Installed 50→**49**; Built 25→**24**. Credential rotation intentionally deferred until go-live (Mike decision 2026-08-05) — not a blocker.

**Net math:** After PR #40 on master: Total **147**, Built **28**, Planned **23**, Decision Needed **6**, Superseded **3**. PR #41 then: SC-032 Planned→Built (Built **29**, Planned **22**); SC-114 Decision→Superseded (Decision Needed **5**, Superseded **4**). SC-147 is the only item added by PR #40. No silent Complete↔Live Tested swaps. **2026-07-25:** SC-002 Built→Installed (Installed **55**, Built **28**) for SCN-001–020 PROD catalog; PR #43 repo fixtures SCN-021–026 remain Built pending PROD install (do not count as Live Tested).

**Reading tip:** “Installed but not tested” remains large — many pipelines still need Schmidt re-proof after the empty-base reset. **Weekly email (2026-07-24):** `118→072 v4.0→119→074→Make Bulk Email May 18` E2E PASS with empty-week **`send_short`**; **074 PROD sendMode=Live** (never fixed Test) + Make Live writeback PASS (`Weekly Email Sent?`, `Make Send Status=Sent`, `Weekly Summary Sent At`); **118/119 schedules ON** (Sun 5:00 / 10:00 AM Denver). Repo **118 v1.5** is the Live-season functional fix; **119 v1.5** is docs/CONFIG alignment only. Do not disable schedules based on older OFF guidance. **Launch certification (2026-07-25):** PR #42 merged; READY WITH NON-BLOCKING FOLLOW-UPS; public `/shoot` re-smoked PASS (SC-102 Live Tested). **SC-147** Built in Repository. **SC-032** Built (not live-installed). Softr Obsolete / Not Used. Architecture: `docs/next-wave/was-email/WAS-WEEKLY-EMAIL-ARCHITECTURE.md`. Config rows year-specific (do not collapse). Current 067/115 proof is recorded in §2A; it does not make the broader season matrix live-tested. 020 PROD = v3.0.0. **054 v5.6** + **066 v3.3** Installed. **Cloud agent Airtable API token missing** — Schmidt mutation packages blocked until env PAT added (`docs/prod-completion/2026-07-25/ACCESS-BLOCKER.md`).

#### Reviewer-link architecture (SC-150) — 2026-08-04 — **Complete**

| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Object privacy | S3 bucket `shooting-challenge-assets` remains private |
| Permanent coach click target | Airtable formula **`Reviewer File URL`** |
| Permanent S3 identity | **`Canonical File URL`** (not clickable anonymously) |
| Auth for open | Stable per-asset **`Reviewer Access Token`** (URL-safe, ≥32 random bytes; preserved on retry) |
| Viewer | PROD Function URL `GET /file/{recordId}?token=…` → 302 to ~15 min presigned `GetObject` |
| Final status owner | **Lambda** is authoritative for successful upload writeback; successful assets finish as **`Upload Status = Uploaded`** (not Processing / Pending Link) |
| Private access path | Coaches open private S3 objects only through the tokenized reviewer endpoint (`Reviewer File URL`) |
| Parent homework email (071) | **Complete** — parent-facing file links use **`Reviewer File URL` → Google Drive View URL → Google Drive File URL** (v3.5). PROD paste + operator-attested live send 2026-08-05 on `recH71jEgjxzLup6F`. Make marks Sent? after Gmail. |

## 6. Recommended Build Order

Optimized for **speed in the emptied PROD base**. Stop criteria are listed per phase.

| Phase | Focus | Exit criteria before moving on |
|------:|-------|--------------------------------|
| **1** | Schema and field ownership | Fresh schema export started; ownership matrix draft for core tables; no known dual writers on XP/email fields |
| **2** | Config and XP Reward Rules | Grade Bands + XP Reward Rules readable; critical hardcodes inventoried |
| **3** | Testing framework | Schmidt enrollment + Testing views + scenario approach decided (incl. 115-in-PROD decision) |
| **4** | Enrollment and Weeks | Athlete/Enrollment/Weeks seeded for test season; intake rules documented |
| **5** | Daily submissions and XP | Schmidt daily submission → XP Event idempotent |
| **6** | Homework and Learning Activities | File + written HC path live-tested; quiz decision made; LA schema only after HC stable |
| **7** | Video and storage | Video upload writeback re-proven; 070a enable decision executed or explicitly deferred |
| **8** | Streaks, milestones, achievements, Perfect Week | 053/066/059/057 live-tested on Schmidt |
| **9** | Levels and gates | Block + clear proven; Zoom credit participates correctly |
| **10** | Zoom | Live + recording exclusivity + approval email path decided/tested |
| **11** | Weekly summaries | Guaranteed WAS create + calc proven |
| **12** | Emails and communication center | Weekly WAS Live proven; **WELCOME Hub handoff (079) controlled-test proven**; participant welcome + approved Hub template pending; homework/video/Zoom paths per SC-045; EMC still deferred |
| **13** | Website integrations | Empty/error states OK; catalogs read live config; Presentation wiring as available |
| **14** | Full live end-to-end test | SC-005 matrix mostly green on Schmidt |
| **15** | Cleanup and final sign-off | Obsolete fields/tables, inventory filled, stale docs refreshed, intake reopen decision |

---

## 7. Mike Decisions

Only decisions that need Mike (not pure engineering choices):

| ID | Decision needed | Why it matters |
|----|-----------------|----------------|
| SC-044 | Major-event alerts: SMS vs email; parent vs athlete; opt-in rules? | Product/comms policy |
| SC-066 | Keep early-bird period for next season? | Calendar/config work |
| ~~SC-068~~ | ~~Schmidt Active? vs standings~~ | **Resolved in Foundation Reset:** Active?=true for processing; exclude standings via view filter (no new field) |
| SC-081 | Change streak repeat-after-break behavior, or only tune amounts? | Code vs config |
| SC-095 | When to turn **070a** homework S3 upload ON in PROD? | Currently intentionally OFF |
| SC-112 | Athlete auth approach for real dashboard/profiles? | Unlocks web Phase 3 |
| SC-115 | Public indexing (noindex removal)? (SC-114 Softr cutover is Superseded — Softr Obsolete) | Public traffic / SEO |
| SC-067 | When to schedule Program Instance multi-year wave? | Large architecture |
| SC-002 / SC-006 | Build Scenario Library + auto Expected-vs-Actual now or later? | Testing investment level |

**Resolved this pack**

| ID | Decision | Outcome |
|----|----------|---------|
| SC-001 | Testing Scenarios / 115 in PROD? | **Allowed and Live Tested** — dry + live + rerun PASS; orchestration only |
| SC-004 | Schmidt Active? | **Active?=true**; **keep Schmidt visible** on public standings (do not add exclusion filter) |
| SC-014 | Quiz path A (PDF) vs B (attachment-less)? | **Option B** — attachment-less; no Quiz Result PDF field; no fake attachment; use existing 067 path |
| SC-035 | Empty-week parent email policy? | **`send_short`** — short no-activity reminder; do not suppress; do not send full normal weekly summary |

---

## 8. Superseded and Duplicate Items

Map older IDs into SC items so they are not tracked as separate unfinished work.

| Older ID(s) | Maps to | Notes |

| V2-001 | SC-125 → SC-067 | Archive/clone superseded by Program Instance |
| V2-013 | SC-067 | Multi-year |
| V2-015 | SC-122 | Production base — **retired DEV 2026-08-19**; production-only |

| Softr cutover (Obsolete) / indexing / publish-flag rename | SC-114 Superseded; SC-115; SC-144 | Web cluster — Softr not a launch gate |

**Historical conflicts and their current disposition (do not re-open as separate work):**

| Topic | Newer truth | Stale sources |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Zoom recording | PROD **117 v2.1** = Hub Email Handoff Queue create (SC-088 path evolved). Stage 17 credit scripts are design alternatives (SC-074 / SC-086). Live Zoom XP = **101**. Make **117f** historical. | Older “orchestrator ON as 117” or “email → Make 117f” as current truth are stale — see §1A / §9L |
| C-013 video | PROD E2E done historically (SC-094) | Brief Wave 7 queued; some close-out “open” rows |
| H-002 / 066 | The v3.3 `createRecords` failure is historical; current controlled 066 evidence is recorded in the dated release evidence and must be verified against live Airtable state | Older “paste pending” / “checkbox didn’t fire” briefs |
| C-011 | Repo ready (SC-035+) | Backlog plain “queued” without repo-ready nuance |
| C-023 / 116 | Historical installation and Production evidence remain evidence only; current live state belongs to Airtable and the named release package | Older install and paste queues |
| production-only workflow | Production-only since DEV retirement 2026-08-19; repository guardrail | Historical production-first operating-mode packet; retired DEV runbooks (read-only banners) |
| Testing Scenarios / 115 | Controlled PROD proof for 115 v2.1 is recorded in §2A; one explicit checked request creates one Submission by design | Older “never paste 115” or v2.0 status text |

## 9. Work Packages

### 9A. Foundation Reset Pack (empty PROD) — **EXECUTED 2026-07-23** (docs/schema/Schmidt)

Still open from that pack: **115 paste**, remaining **Testing views**, leaderboard Schmidt exclusion view filter.

### 9B. Production Automation Reconciliation — **SUPERSEDED IN PART by overnight Agent 1 baseline (2026-07-23)**

**Prior deliverables (still useful history):** `docs/foundation-reset/Production-PROD-AUTOMATION-RECONCILIATION-2026-07-23.md` + `.json`

**Overnight Agent 1 live baseline (controlling for current PROD facts):** `docs/overnight/testing-integrity/CURRENT-PROD-BASELINE.md`

| Prior recon claim | Overnight Agent 1 claim |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| PROD 50/50; no 115 | **115 installed**; ~4 free slots |
| Delete 112 first to free 115 | 115 already live-tested (dry+live PASS) |
| Do not delete 032/033/063/111 for capacity | Baseline claims **032, 033, 063, 111 deleted** (plus **043**) |
| 013/020/030 upgrade open | Baseline claims **013, 020, 030** replaced with newer versions |

**Required Mike action:** UI-attest the Agent 1 delete/upgrade set before treating SC-058/SC-059 as Complete. Earlier “do not delete 032/033/063/111” guidance and the overnight baseline **conflict** — do not ignore.

**Historical next package (superseded for 118/119):** `docs/next-wave/data-model/MIKE-ACTIONS.md` — the old v1.5 paste instruction is retained as history. Current 118/119 v1.7 installation, restored production inputs, schedules, and no-target proofs are recorded in the 2026-08-08 reconciliation; positive arming still awaits an eligible completed Week/package.

### 9C. Overnight multi-agent run — **RECONCILED 2026-07-23** (Agent 6)

**Deliverables:** `docs/overnight/FINAL-OVERNIGHT-RECONCILIATION.md`, `docs/overnight/MIKE-ACTIONS-TOMORROW.md`, `docs/overnight/web-integration/*`

Confirmed direction preserved: PROD active; Schmidt visible; Weeks manual; website (`/shoot`) reads live config; Softr Obsolete / Not Used; athlete auth / noindex remain Mike decisions.

### 9D. Next-wave Agents 9–12 + Agent 13 final reconciliation — **2026-07-24**

**Deliverables:** `docs/next-wave/final-reconciliation/` · packages under `docs/next-wave/{automation-ownership,config-selection,homework-pipeline,was-email}/`

Key corrections applied: Config year registry (no collapse); 063/111 supersession classifications; 020 v3.0.0 canonical; weekly email `118→072→119→074→Make` verified; formula-only XP Dedupe Keys; WAS hybrid creators; dual-writer inventory.

### 9E. Repository completion packs — **2026-07-25** (PR #43 + PR #44)

**PR #43** (`cursor/sc-completion-threshold-date-311c`) — canonical automation code:

| Package | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **SC-049 / XP-D1 Weekly Threshold writer** | **Live Tested in PROD** | **035 v1.2** pasted; Schmidt first-award 3 created + duplicate rerun 0/3; automation **OFF** pending PR #50 merged-source reconciliation; evidence `2026-08-03-035-v1.2-schmidt-live-proof.md` |
| **SC-021 / 057 Denver date keys** | **Installed in PROD** | **057 v1.5** installed/running (includes v1.4 Denver Intl helper + unloadData guard); live Perfect Week fixtures still open — `057-perfect-week-v1.5-live-verification.md` |
| **SC-002 fixtures SCN-021–026** | Built in Repository | HW/Video/Zoom/Threshold fixtures; **not** Live Tested |

**PR #44** (`cursor/prod-completion-pack-cbb3`) — stacked on #43; unique ops pack (no duplicate 057 code):

| Package | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Public `/shoot` smoke (SC-102) | **Live Tested** — all routes 200 + health tokenValid |
| 067 Option B install packet (SC-013/014) | **Live Tested in PROD** (2026-08-04) — see Package 02 evidence |
| 057 v1.4 paste runbook | Points at PR #43 code + `057-PERFECT-WEEK-PROD-PASTE.md` |
| SCN-027/028 quiz fixtures | **Built** |
| Access blocker doc | Historical — PAT available for Package 02 |

**Not claimed Complete / season-enabled for 035:** Automation remains **OFF** until Mike enables.
**067:** Live Tested Option B (SC-013/014). **057 v1.4:** Still Ready for PROD Paste.
**Next:** Paste **057 v1.4** → Schmidt Denver Perfect Week boundary → enable 035 only when approved → SC-075/076 → SC-077.

### 9F. Landing domain / navigation branding audit — **2026-08-04** (SC-149)

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Status** | **Built in Repository** (not Installed / Live Tested until Vercel deploy + env confirmed) |
| **Official landing** | `https://www.fairfieldbasketballclub.com` |
| **Shooting Challenge route** | `https://www.fairfieldbasketballclub.com/shoot` |
| **Retired primary destination** | `https://www.hoopchallenges.com` (and typo `hooopchallenges.com`) |

**What changed (active production code / config examples):**

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| Defaults | `PUBLIC_LANDING_ORIGIN` / `resolveLandingUrl` / `resolveSiteUrl` → Fairfield; never fall back to Hoop Challenges |
| Chrome | Header logo, wordmark, footer branding, `BackToHubLink` (“Home”) → Fairfield landing |
| Env examples | Root + `web/.env*.example` use Fairfield for `NEXT_PUBLIC_LANDING_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` |
| Active docs | `APP_CONTEXT.md`, `docs/deployment-notes.md`, `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` URL table, selected `web/docs/*` |

**Tests added/updated:**

1. Logo → `https://www.fairfieldbasketballclub.com` (Playwright + chrome contract)
2. Header/footer landing links correct (Playwright + source contract)
3. No active code defaults to Hoop Challenges (`app-config` + chrome tests)
4. Env-variable normalization (legacy hosts, typo host, blank, malformed)
5. `/shoot` application path intact (`resolveSiteUrl`, `withBasePath`, Playwright URL)
6. Internal SC nav stays app-relative (not redirected to landing)

**Unresolved / Mike follow-ups:**

- Confirm Vercel production env vars are Fairfield (code rewrites legacy values, but env should match).
- Live smoke after deploy (logo + footer + `/shoot` routes).
- Historical docs/evidence that still mention `hoopchallenges.com` remain **archives** — do not treat as active config.
- Shared `BRAND_STANDARDS.md` still lists Hoop Challenges as public site (canonical copy lives in landing repo) — synchronize via approved cross-repo brand update when ready.

### 9G. Production `/shoot` smoke package — **2026-08-04** (SC-118)

**Deliverables:** `web/tests/production-smoke.spec.ts`, `web/scripts/http-smoke.mjs`, `docs/testing/PRODUCTION-SMOKE-RUNBOOK.md`, evidence under `docs/testing/evidence/PRODUCTION-SMOKE-2026-08-04.md`

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Production build | PASS (evidence date) |
| Vitest | PASS (evidence date) |
| Playwright local smoke | PASS (evidence date) |
| Playwright prod smoke (`fairfieldbasketballclub.com/shoot`) | PASS (evidence date; read-only against then-current PROD) |
| HTTP prod smoke | PASS — Fillout + landing URLs exact; assets 200; API `tokenValid` |
| Material console errors | None on smoked routes |
| Broken links / duplicated `/shoot/shoot` | None found |
| SC-118 | **Built in Repository — smoke suite successfully executed against current PROD** (not Installed/Live Tested for this integration branch until Mike deploys + checks) |

**Remaining launch risks (separate work packages):** SC-112 athlete auth (dashboard still demo); SC-115 noindex decision; SC-109 Game Manual PDF env if Adobe URL still unset; catalog Presentation fields (SC-054/SC-117); optional CI wiring for `npm run test:smoke`.

### 9M. Communications Hub WELCOME email integration — **2026-08-08**

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Scope** | Shooting Challenge enrollment **WELCOME** and counted Submission **DAILY_SUBMISSION** handoffs to **Communications Hub** (not Make.com) |
| **PROD flow** | `Email Handoff Queue` → shared Automation **079** → Communications Hub → Resend → **Delivery** audit record |
| **Make.com** | **OFF** — must remain off for welcome delivery |
| **Controlled test** | **Live Tested in PROD** — end-to-end handoff, Hub dedupe (parent/athlete same email → one Delivery), replay protection (same Handoff Key → no duplicate send) |
| **Participant sends** | **Not authorized** — **Test Mode?** + allowlist only |
| **Hub content** | Hub **WELCOME** template renders subject/HTML from `templateKey: WELCOME` + Payload JSON (`athleteName`, `programName`, `message`) — final approved design pending |
| **079 contract** | Queue supplies Event Type, Template Key, Handoff Key, Source Table/ID, Recipients JSON, Payload JSON, **Test Mode?** — **not** subject, HTML, plain-text, or `sendMode`; v2.0 accepts WELCOME plus exact `DAILY_SUBMISSION|SUBMISSIONS|{Submission Record ID}` keys |
| **Accepted vs delivery** | Queue/Hub Event **Accepted** = intake only; success = one Hub **Delivery** in **`Sent`**, provider id, one attempt, no stale error/retry fields |
| **Source-table issue** | Earlier Hub Event missing source table = **Hub-side mapping omission** — **not** a 079 defect; no 079 change required |
| **Legacy build** | Automation **075** is **LEGACY RETIRED** (absent from live Automations; do not restore). Live welcome producer is **078A** → Email Handoff Queue → **079**. PR **#274** merged/deployed. All six Enrollment legacy welcome fields deleted (2026-08-29) — see [`deploy-checklists/RETIRE-LEGACY-WELCOME-EMAIL-FIELDS.md`](./deploy-checklists/RETIRE-LEGACY-WELCOME-EMAIL-FIELDS.md). |
| **Repo source** | Automation **079 v2.0** is now authoritative in GitHub as the shared WELCOME/DAILY_SUBMISSION dispatcher; Production replacement remains pending |
| **SC-079 naming** | Completion item SC-079 (*gate blocking*) uses Automation **042** — unrelated to Automation slot **079** |
| **Docs** | `docs/communications-hub/WELCOME-EMAIL-INTEGRATION.md` · `docs/deploy-checklists/WELCOME-EMAIL-ACTIVATION-CHECKLIST.md` · `docs/deploy-checklists/WELCOME-EMAIL-CONTROLLED-TEST-RUNBOOK.md` |
| **Status** | **Installed in PROD + Live Tested (controlled only)** — participant activation blocked on checklist § activation doc |

**Proven live (controlled test only):**

1. 079 posts WELCOME handoff from Email Handoff Queue to Communications Hub.
2. Hub creates Hub Event, sends via Resend, writes Delivery audit.
3. Duplicate parent/athlete email → one Delivery.
4. Same Handoff Key replay → no second send.
5. DAILY_SUBMISSION forwarding is covered offline; no live Hub call or Production rerun is claimed by this repository change.

**Still required before participant welcome emails:**

1. Final approved welcome copy and branding.
2. Hub **WELCOME** template implementation and review (Hub-owned subject/HTML from `templateKey: WELCOME`).
3. Recipient / consent / authorization review.
4. New controlled test after template change.
5. Explicit Mike approval for non-test participant sends.
6. Post-send Delivery audit and opt-out/suppression verification.

**Do not claim:** participant-wide welcome sends enabled; Make.com welcome path active; **Accepted** alone equals delivered email; operator supplies subject/HTML/`sendMode` on the queue row.

### 9M.1. Communications Hub DAILY_SUBMISSION migration — **2026-08-12**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Scope** | Automation 076 creates one `DAILY_SUBMISSION` Email Handoff Queue row; Hub owns rendering and delivery |
| **Handoff key** | `DAILY_SUBMISSION|SUBMISSIONS|{Submission Record ID}` |
| **079** | Shared dispatcher v2.0; preserves WELCOME and now accepts exact DAILY_SUBMISSION keys |
| **077** | **Deleted from Production** (2026-08-13) | Retired Make/Gmail daily-submission path; automation slot recovered. GitHub source archived. Daily email uses Hub path (076 → 079). |
| **Payload** | Required: `athleteName`, `activityDate`, `weekName`, `shots`, `makes`; optional: `submissionXp`, `submissionXpStatus`, `programName`, `message`, `shootingPercentage`, `weeklyShots`, `weeklyGoal`, `weeklyGoalPercentage`, `weeklyXp`, `currentStreak`, `currentLevel`, `nextLevel`, `homeworkSubmitted`, `homeworkAssignments`, `homeworkReviewStatus` |
| **Trigger** | Recommended trigger requires `Build Daily Email Now?` checked plus `Count This Submission?` evaluating `1`; 031 validates `Simple Total`/`Detailed Shooting`, final summary linkage, eligible XP-link repair, and final validation; 076 applies the same guard and consumes/clears the signal |
| **Status** | **Repository-ready / controlled Production promotion blocked pending trigger-owner/timing verification** — 076 v8.5 single-select write correction complete; no Production paste performed |
| **Promotion** | [`docs/deploy-checklists/PKG-006-DAILY-SUBMISSION-HUB-HANDOFF.md`](./deploy-checklists/PKG-006-DAILY-SUBMISSION-HUB-HANDOFF.md) |

### 9N. GitHub Issue #116 full audit — **2026-08-08**

The dated audit packet [`docs/prod-completion/2026-08-08/ISSUE-116-FULL-AUDIT.md`](./prod-completion/2026-08-08/ISSUE-116-FULL-AUDIT.md) is the current repository-wide truth and execution handoff.

- Core submission chain: **023 Live Tested**; 031 and 010 repository repairs are **Built-Merged / Needs UI Proof**.
- Remaining high-risk defects: orphan/eligibility-loss XP (**#100/#102**), video source validation (**#101**), downstream homework/email source safety (**#104/#105**).
- Repository contract drift was repaired: tests now assert current **031 v3.5** and **118/119 v1.7** contracts where applicable.
- Repository evidence does not prove Airtable editor installation, trigger configuration, Make state, Vercel environment values, or live email delivery.
- The audit packet contains the ranked blockers, shortest execution path, exact UI-only actions, and stale queue removals.

### 9L. Automation 117 ownership reconcile — **2026-08-05** (overlay 2026-08-19)

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Root cause | Repository once treated Stage 17 credit orchestrator (+ modular 117a/117c) as active Automation **117**; PROD slot **117** is the recording-approval **email handoff** |
| PROD Automation 117 (Mike paste 2026-08-19) | `117 - Zoom - Create Zoom Recording Approval Communications Hub Handoff` (**v2.1** / Last Updated 2026-08-17) |
| Historical UI name (2026-08-05 packet) | `117 — Zoom — Send Recording Approval Email to Make` (**v1.1**) — superseded for current version/name |
| Behavior | Creates one Ready **Email Handoff Queue** row; does **not** write XP; does **not** call Make/Gmail/Resend. **079** → Hub → Resend |
| Canonical repo file | `airtable/automations/shooting-challenge/117-zoom-send-recording-approval-email-to-make.js` |
| Make identifier **117f** | **Historical** Gmail path only — not current send plane |
| Disposition | Orchestrator + 117a–e remain under `_design-alternatives/stage17-modular-reference/` |
| unloadData pack correction | §9K paste targets are **031, 035, 042, 057, 114, 118, 119** only — do **not** paste orchestrator over PROD 117 |
| Status | **Live paste confirmed v2.1** (Mike 2026-08-19 script paste) |
| Offline tests | `node tests/zoom/automation-117-recording-approval-email.test.js` |
| Runbook | Older Make runbooks are historical where they conflict with Hub → Resend |

### 9K. Active automation unloadData runtime compatibility pack — **2026-08-05**

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Defect class | Bare `QueryResult.unloadData()` unsupported in current Airtable automation runtime |
| Prior live failures that established the defect | Automation **001** (`athletesQuery.unloadData`), Automation **002** (`gradeBandQuery.unloadData`) — already fixed (v5.2 / v8.2); not modified in this pack |
| Affected automations (this pack — PROD paste) | **031, 035, 042, 057, 114, 118, 119** |
| Correction (2026-08-05) | Earlier drafts incorrectly listed **117 / 117a / 117c**. Live PROD **117** is email-only (no unloadData). Orchestrator/117a/117c are design alternatives — **do not paste** over PROD 117. See §9L. |
| Repo fix | Each paste-target script gains `unloadQuerySafe()`; bare cleanup replaced; `finally` where the script owns the query lifecycle |
| Status | **Built in Repository** — Airtable paste still required for the seven paste targets; live PROD tests still required |
| Offline tests | `node tests/airtable-runtime/active-automation-unload-compat.test.js` + related version-pin suites |
| Paste runbook | `docs/deploy-checklists/active-automation-unloadData-compat.md` |
| Exclusions | PROD email Automation 117; `_design-alternatives/*`; `_superseded/*`; 001/002 already remediated |

### 9J. Automation 002 unloadData runtime fix — **2026-08-05** (SC-023 / enrollment Grade Band)

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Defect | PROD Automation 002 failed while assigning Grade Band for 2026–2027 Testing Schmidt enrollment |
| Enrollment | `recCyFEPeATOVNlr9` |
| Athlete | `recgqVstObQRzgXJF` |
| Error | `gradeBandQuery.unloadData is not a function` at debugStep `8 - Find Matching Grade Band` |
| Root cause | Bare `gradeBandQuery.unloadData()` is not available in this Airtable automation runtime (same class as Automation 001 v5.2) |
| Repo fix | **002 v8.2** — `unloadQuerySafe()`; optional typeof guard; `finally` cleanup that cannot abort successful Grade Band match/assign or mask a real match error |
| Status | **Built in Repository** — PROD paste + live rerun still required (do not mark Live Tested/Complete from repo alone) |
| Offline tests | `node tests/enrollment-intake/automation-002-unload-compat.test.js` |
| Canonical paste path | `airtable/automations/shooting-challenge/002-enrollment-intake-and-setup-assign-grade-band-initial.js` |
| Paste runbook | `docs/deploy-checklists/002-unloadData-runtime-fix.md` |
| Follow-up | ~~Additional bare `.unloadData()` in 031–119~~ → remediated in §9K (2026-08-05). Superseded archive copies remain excluded. |

### 9I. Automation 001 unloadData runtime fix — **2026-08-05** (SC-060 / SC-061)

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Defect | PROD Automation 001 failed on 2026–2027 Testing Schmidt enrollment |
| Enrollment | `recQP4N5acTdK40uZ` |
| Error | `athletesQuery.unloadData is not a function` at debugStep `10 - Update Existing Athlete` |
| Root cause | Bare `queryResult.unloadData()` is not available in this Airtable automation runtime |
| Repo fix | **001 v5.2** — `unloadQuerySafe()`; optional typeof guard; finally cleanup that cannot abort successful match/link |
| Status | **Built in Repository** — PROD paste + live rerun still required (do not mark Live Tested/Complete from repo alone) |
| Offline tests | `node tests/enrollment-intake/automation-001-unload-compat.test.js` |
| Canonical paste path | `airtable/automations/shooting-challenge/001-enrollment-intake-and-setup-find-or-create-athlete-and-link-enrollment.js` |
| Paste runbook | `docs/deploy-checklists/001-v5.2-unloadData-runtime-fix.md` |

### 9H. Mobile usability + accessibility package — **2026-08-04** (SC-148)

**Status:** **Built in Repository** (not Installed / Live Tested until Vercel deploy + Mike smoke)

| Area audited | Findings fixed | Remaining / notes |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Homepage hero | Full-width mobile CTAs; clearer hero muted contrast token | No redesign; brand structure preserved |
| Registration gateway | 44px CTAs; also pinned at top of mobile menu | Fillout remains external (`target=_blank`) |
| Header / mobile menu | Replaced horizontal-scroll nav with dialog menu; Escape + focus return; body scroll lock | Desktop/tablet keep primary + More dropdown |
| Logo / nav links | Logo hit area ≥44px; labelled logo/wordmark; More menu aria-label | Fairfield landing links from SC-149 |
| Buttons / CTAs | Default/sm/icon sizes raised to 44px+ | Dense `xs` left for non-primary chrome |
| Forms / inputs | Existing `.sc-input` already 44px; focus ring strengthened | Few public forms today |
| Cards / standings | Table header icons decorative; mobile card list unchanged structurally | Live leaderboard needs `AIRTABLE_API_TOKEN` in env |
| Athlete dashboard | Profile text link underlined + min height | Auth still SC-112 Decision Needed |
| Footer | Quick links use `.sc-text-link` (underlined, blue) | Fairfield home link |
| Loading / empty / error | Clearer copy hierarchy; `role=status` / `role=alert`; mobile-friendly action stacking | — |

**Viewports:** 375×812, 768×1024, 1440×900

**Unresolved follow-ups (non-blocking for this package):**
- Full axe-core audit not yet wired (tracked under SC-118)
- Contrast of decorative court-line overlays on hero remains a visual-design judgment call
- Athlete auth/dashboard real data blocked on SC-112
- Production install = merge + Vercel deploy (Root Directory `web`)
- Do not use page-wide `overflow-x: clip` in ways that hide tables/leaderboards

## 10. Post-app / backlog considerations

### Decouple Daily Submission email readiness from Automation 031

**Status:** **POST-APP consideration — not a blocker for Shooting Challenge
completion, Production promotion, or PKG-006 controlled proof.**

**Current design:** Automation 031 is the final proven processing checkpoint.
After validating the counted Submission's canonical Enrollment, Week, Program
Instance, Weekly Athlete Summary linkage, and eligible XP links, it checks
`Build Daily Email Now?`. Automation 076 consumes that signal and creates the
`DAILY_SUBMISSION` Communications Hub handoff.

**Reason for later review:** Although safe and practical, Automation 031 belongs
to Weekly Summary processing and now also owns the Daily Submission
email-readiness signal.

**Future options to evaluate:**

- A formula-backed `Daily Submission Processing Complete?` readiness field
- A dedicated workflow coordinator
- Another existing final-processing owner
- A durable source-status/writeback design that prevents premature sends and
  duplicate processing

**Acceptance criteria for any future change:**

- No new Airtable automation slot unless justified
- Email cannot trigger before canonical Submission processing finishes
- Pending XP remains supported
- Deterministic queue/replay protection remains intact
- 031 returns to Weekly Athlete Summary responsibilities only
- 076 and shared 079/Communications Hub architecture remains intact

This is technical-debt cleanup only. It must not block merging the v3.8
hotfix, installing 031/076, running the controlled Production Daily Submission
test, completing PKG-006, or finishing the app.

---

## Maintenance

When finishing an SC item:

1. Update **Current Status**, **What Is Still Needed**, **Last Updated**, and dashboard counts.
2. Add evidence links (deploy checklist, record IDs, commit SHA).
3. Mark Complete only when repo + PROD install + live PROD test are all true (where applicable).
4. Prefer editing this file over reopening parallel status in the old backlog.
