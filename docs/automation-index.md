## Live MCP inventory overlay (2026-09-12)

Base **`appn84sqPw03zEbTT`** — Airtable MCP `list_automations`: **50** automations · **48 deployed** · **2 undeployed**. Full packet: [`audits/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH-RECONCILIATION-20260912.md`](./audits/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH-RECONCILIATION-20260912.md).

**Deployed:** 001, 002, 003, 007a, 010, 013, 020–023, 030–035, 041, 042, 053–059, 064–067, 070a/b/c, 071–074, 076, 078, 078A, 079, 101, 113, 114, 116–120.

**Undeployed (present, OFF — confirm in UI; do not reopen/paste from docs alone):** **005**, **009**.

**Legacy / absent (do not restore):** 006, 007 (replaced by 007a), 008, 012, 043, 063, 068, 075, 077, 111, 112, 115.

This overlay documents live presence only. Historical Live Tested version claims below remain evidence; they do not authorize script changes when MCP shows undeployed/absent.

**Reliability audit (2026-07-24):** [next-wave/reliability-audit-2026-07-24/REPORT.md](./next-wave/reliability-audit-2026-07-24/REPORT.md) — trust bands, input/dedupe/ownership audits, ranked repairs, Mike actions. **Do not create a second index.**

**Reference corrections:** 012→**020**; 051/052→**053→054**; **075 is LEGACY RETIRED** (historical Enrollment welcome *build* only — not live; not Zoom XP); Zoom live XP=**101**; recording approval **email** = Automation **117 v2.4** → Email Handoff Queue → **079** → Communications Hub → **Resend** (Make 117f Gmail is historical); **WELCOME = 078A → Email Handoff Queue → 079 → Communications Hub → Resend**; recording XP credit has **no** deployed Airtable writer under slot 117. Current email plane: [integrations/email-send-plane.md](./integrations/email-send-plane.md). Legacy Enrollment fields `Parent Email Subject`, `Parent Email HTML`, `Welcome Email Status`, `Welcome Email Sent At`, `Welcome Email Error`, `Welcome Email Ready?` are retired — see [deploy-checklists/RETIRE-LEGACY-WELCOME-EMAIL-FIELDS.md](./deploy-checklists/RETIRE-LEGACY-WELCOME-EMAIL-FIELDS.md).

**C-020 test harness:** **115** v2.1 in repo and controlled PROD Homework proof passed 2026-08-10 (ETF; Homework scenarios require PHA RID). The allowlist is limited to the two approved Schmidt enrollments. Each explicit checked `Run Test?` request intentionally creates one new production-shaped Submission; an unchecked trigger is skipped. This is not an idempotent Submission processor. Daily/HW/Video Production history remains historical; the current proof does not claim full downstream or season end-to-end behavior. [upload workflow](./upload-workflow-homework-video.md), [checklist](./deploy-checklists/C-020-testing-scenarios-script-checklist.md).

**Modernization roadmap:** [v2-014-automation-modernization-roadmap.md](./v2-014-automation-modernization-roadmap.md) — master inventory, disposition, capacity plan (Phase 2).

**Wave 2A classification (complete):** [v2-014-wave-2a-classification.md](./v2-014-wave-2a-classification.md) — Category A–F + complexity for all 46 scripts.

## Email handoffs (070b/070c upload are not parent email)

Current parent/athlete **email delivery** is Communications Hub → **Resend**. Make.com is not the email sender (Mike 2026-08-19). [email send plane](./integrations/email-send-plane.md).

### Weekly Athlete Summary email

**Current send plane:** `118 → 072 → 119 → 074 → 079 → Communications Hub → Resend`

**Historical (2026-07-24):** `118 → 072 → 119 → 074 → Make.com → Gmail → Make.com writeback` — preserved in [WAS-WEEKLY-EMAIL-ARCHITECTURE.md](./next-wave/was-email/WAS-WEEKLY-EMAIL-ARCHITECTURE.md). That Make/Gmail path is not current.

| # | Airtable automation name | Trigger / schedule | File / notes |
|---|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| **118** | Email — Schedule Weekly Summary Email Build | Sunday **5:00 AM** America/Denver | `118-email-notifications-and-external-handoffs-schedule-weekly-summary-email-build.js` (**GitHub v2.3; Live v2.1 pending SC-121 paste** — arms build; does not send email) |

| **074** | Email — Weekly summary Hub handoff | WAS Ready? + !Sent? + Send to Make? + package fields | `074-…-send-weekly-summary-email-package-to-make.js` — GitHub is Hub queue create (filename still says Make). **Does not send via Make/Gmail.** Current delivery is Hub → Resend. Historical 2026-07-24 Make webhook proof is evidence only. |
| **079** | Email — Send queue handoff to Communications Hub | Email Handoff Queue when Status is Ready | Shared dispatcher to Hub / Resend |
| Make (historical) | `Weekly Athlete Summary - Bulk Email - May 18` | Retired for email | Do not treat as the current sender |

**Not the email sender:** Make `Weekly Athlete Summary Updated` (WAS calculation create/update).

### Other handoffs

070a/070b/070c are **upload** paths to Make/Lambda, not parent email.

| # | Airtable automation name | Trigger | File |
|---|--------------------------|---------|------|
| 070b | Upload — Send Video Asset Payload to Make | Submission Assets · `Send to Make Trigger` checked · `Upload Status = Pending Link` · `Upload Destination = Video Feedback` | Upload path, **not parent email**. Production Automations Code **v4.7** (`fetch`). Historical C-013 proof was **v4.4** (2026-07-11). |
| **070c** | Upload — Verify Async Video Asset Upload | Submission Assets · corrected condition: **`Writeback Complete?` is greater than 0**; verifies Upload Status / Canonical / Storage Key / hashes / Uploaded At / Upload Error | `070c-…js` (**current live / repo v1.1** — **enabled in PROD**; do not invent a new version). Does **not** upload; does **not** replace **070b**. Clears **`Send to Make Trigger`** only after successful verification. Separate from **070a** homework upload. See [HOMEWORK-ASSET-COMPLETION-RUNBOOK.md](./online-agents/homework-assets/HOMEWORK-ASSET-COMPLETION-RUNBOOK.md). |
| 073 | Email — Video feedback Hub handoff | Video Feedback when Parent Feedback Ready? (**manual**) + Feedback Posted? + Coach Feedback + Parent Feedback Sent? unchecked (+ script XP/source gates) | GitHub Hub queue create (**v4.2 Live MATCH**). Delivery Hub → Resend via **079**. Does **not** write Sent?/Sent On (**open** who does). Make/Gmail do **not** send. See [HOMEWORK-ASSET-COMPLETION-RUNBOOK.md](./online-agents/homework-assets/HOMEWORK-ASSET-COMPLETION-RUNBOOK.md) |
| **078** | Email — Mark Homework Parent Feedback Ready | Homework Completions · Satisfactory? + Coach Feedback | **No script** — native Update Record only (`NO SCRIPT - UPDATE RECORD is all.` in Automations Code column). Not an email sender. |

| 075 | ~~Email — Build Challenge Welcome Email~~ | **LEGACY RETIRED — absent from live Automations; do not restore** | Repo file retained as audit archive only. Live Welcome path is **078A → Email Handoff Queue → 079 → Hub → Resend**. Not Zoom XP (that is **101**). |
| **079** | Email — Send WELCOME and DAILY_SUBMISSION Handoffs to Communications Hub | Email Handoff Queue when Status is Ready — *confirm trigger in Airtable* | `079-email-notifications-and-external-handoffs-send-queue-handoff-to-communications-hub.js` (**v2.5** GitHub — shared dispatcher; preserves WELCOME validation/retry/replay and accepts exact `DAILY_SUBMISSION|SUBMISSIONS|{Submission Record ID}` keys; confirm pasted Airtable version in Automations UI) |
| **076** | Email — Create Daily Submission Communications Hub Handoff | Consumes the `Build Daily Email Now?` signal checked only by 031 after count readiness, `Simple Total`/`Detailed Shooting` mode validation, and final summary validation; 076 clears it after queue create/reuse | `076-email-notifications-and-external-handoffs-build-daily-submission-email-package.js` (**v8.17** — `xpEarned` payload + `athleteFirstName`; requires one settled active exact Program Instance + Grade Band goal before preparing a queue; configured zero is permitted, unconfigured/lagged zero is not) |
| **077** | Email — Send Daily Submission Email Package to Make | **Retired / deleted from Production** (2026-08-13) | GitHub archive only; daily email uses Hub 076 → 079 → Resend. Do not restore Make email. |

**Airtable automation-count constraint:** Use consolidated automations where practical. Repository-only modular alternatives must not be represented as active PROD automations. The active canonical automation directory must distinguish deployed scripts from archived/design alternatives.

## Deploy workflow

1. Edit script in GitHub → commit
2. Paste docblock through end into **development** automation (skip GitHub header)
3. Test on sandbox record + run matching audit (dry-run) on **production** base
4. Mike approves promote
5. Paste same script into **production** automation
6. Update `CHANGELOG.md` and this index if trigger/name changed

Runbook: [production-base-setup.md](./production-base-setup.md) (V2-015).
